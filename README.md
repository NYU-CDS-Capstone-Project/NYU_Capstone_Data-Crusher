# Question Generation for Earning Calls - Data Crushers

Our goal is to develop a modeling framework for the JPMC Investor Relations team to prepare for upcoming earning calls.  Given a set of analysts, our framework will output a set of predicted question tags and a set of generated questions for each analyst.  The outputted tags originate from an internal tagger, while the generated questions are developed from an existing data-set.
