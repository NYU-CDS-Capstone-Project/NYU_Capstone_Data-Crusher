       "'On net interest income , do you have an outlook for how the net interest income dollars could trend from here , assuming that you don’t get much help from higher rates , what are the key drivers ? And what’s kind of your outlook for NIM and NII dollars for the year ?On your deposit discussion about pushing out , I think you said during your Investor Day that you would like to get about $3B of non-core deposits off the balance sheet , and I know you said that you hope to make progress in Q2. How should we model that out ? And what type of benefit have you modeled out to the NIM with that $3B of deposits ?Thank you so much for giving us a detailed rundown in terms of how you’re thinking about your liquidity strategy . And I also appreciate the $28.4B in deposit growth came from consumer and escrow . But taking a step back of the $1.2 trillion in period-end deposits , how much would you classify as non-operational corporate ? And I guess , we’re just wondering , is adopting a similar strategy as your other large bank peers on non-operating deposits , will that be able to alleviate some of the liquidity pressure on the NIM without much give-up on the LCR ?I guess , a better way to think about it is a lot of this excess deposit growth is going be positive for your LCR and NSFR given that it looks like it’s mostly retail , so low outflow , high ASF factor type of deposits .On a dynamic that we’re seeing with loan growth outpacing deposit growth across the banking system as a whole . But for the larger banks , including Wells Fargo , I guess , we’re still seeing deposit growth outpacing loan growth . I was hoping that you could just talk about what you think may be driving that ? And do you see anything on the horizon that you think could change that ? I guess , in other words , just lead to loan growth outpacing deposit growth at the large banks as well ?Could you provide any color to help us understand the new loan purchases ? Is there any way to put in context either the yield of the portfolio relative to the existing yield of the Wells Fargo book ? And do you bring over expenses with it ? Or is it largely just interest income coming over as has happened in your prior acquisitions of loan books ?With regards to potential other portfolios that GE had talked about , given your positioning in terms of helping them through the structure , as you mentioned , do you guys get a different look ? Or have you already taken a look at other parts of the book and this is just the first tranche of what could be more ? Or what’s your just general perception of the opportunity set that could come forth for Wells Fargo ?Compared to Q4, the commercial loan growth was a little slower outside of real estate construction . Was some of that seasonal or were there other factors in play there ? How do you feel about the current levels of demand on the commercial side ?I was curious what your early read is on the spring selling season this year . I know you’re starting to see any signs for return of the first time home buyer .Can you talk a little bit more on the housing backlog ? How does it look by region and what are the areas of strength ?On the mortgage competitive landscape here . We saw JPMorgan out earlier today with a big increase in correspondent originations vs . a year ago . And maybe you’ve been a little more consistent in that business . But if you could just remind us on the correspondent and talk about the mix that you’re going after right now ?When you convert your unclosed pipeline of $44B into what would be a normal pull-through into originations in the next quarter , I get to something like $75B to $80B . Does that seem about right in a sense that that’s the kind of run rate you’re getting into at this point ?Good thing is that half of it is already done in the unclosed pipeline . So you at least know that part .On the margin , wanted to get some color on the 13-basis point decline in commercial loan yields . I know you indicated that was partly impacted by fees . Did the lower loan fees account for all of that or how much of it was downward pressure on yields from pricing pressure ?And then how does that play into your margin outlook ? Is it fair to assume still mid-single digit basis points compression per quarter as we move through 2015?Could you talk about loan growth expectations ? You saw declines in your total CRE book . Want to get some thoughts around a sustained inflection in that portfolio organically , and then is it also fair to assume that the loan growth overall should remain in the mid-single digit range at this point ?Can you guys share with us some of the color – you’ve had real big success on the commercial loan growth on a y-over-y basis , in particular , commercial mortgage is real strong . Could you share with us where that growth is coming from . Is it geographically , is it Southeast vs . the Midwest or where is the best growth coming from ?I see . And then can you guys give us any color on the utilization rates of the commercial lines ? Did they go up this quarter ? Some of your peers are suggesting higher utilization rates .And the overall loan book – wheredo you stand like C&I and stuff like that down in the Southeast ?Well , just in terms of growth , I mean like you’re getting good account acquisitions on the loan growth side , where does it stand ?Just a couple of rate-related questions . If we get rising short-term rates but nothing on the long end and I guess in between things go up a little bit but not as much as the short end so you get a flattening yield curve . Remind us how sensitive you are to that scenario ?And just one – ifI could just sneak one more , how should we read into your LCR becoming – beingover 100% relative to the 80% 2015 minimum ? I know that this ratio is quite volatile , but is there an opportunity to maybe add duration to defend the NIM or are you happy to just stay sure and keep this excess ?Bill , let me follow up , Bill Demchak , let me follow up to that answer you just gave . The growth in securities , the longer duration securities , was that in the last couple of quarters you did more synthetics , you used rather than cash . Was this just a shift to cash and rather than using the synthetics or did you actually do more ?Bill , I was kind of wondering if in this environment is your appetite for portfolio purchases or even company acquisitions increase withthe persistence of the low rate environment and what\\'s your take on the supply of those kinds of assets ? I suppose there\\'s lots of folks looking but is there any kind of assets or deals that you might be able to look at and are you more prone to looking now as this goes on ?I might have read that . I might have read something about that .Okay . And then just more broadly beyond that particular seller , just your appetite and whether it changes much as low rates persist ?Last quick thing on just also on low rates , is there any more room on interest expense , anything you could do whether it\\'s deposits or wholesale funding or are you really tapped out on lowering your interest expense potentially ?Well , maybe if I could sneak one more rate question in here . You had made the comment in your prepped remarks about the lower for longer risk having ramifications not just for this year but for out years as well . Is your concern more not just about say a three- or six-month delay and when the Fed moves but about how much they eventually move ? Is that the change , which is the bigger , the when or how much in your mind ?Bill , I had a follow-up question on the comments you just made about your efforts to be well-positioned post-QE . With QE now over we\\'ve started to see loan growth outpace deposit growth across the banking system as a whole but it\\'s interesting that that doesn\\'t appear to be the case for the big banks where deposit growth is still outpacing loan growth according to the H8 data . And I guess as far as PNC goes specifically over the last couple of years we\\'ve seen some quarters where your loan growth has outpaced your deposit growth and others where it\\'s been the reverse . Can you give us a little bit of just speak to what\\'s been driving these trends and I guess what you guys expect going forward ?Bill just on your points about on credit expansion , this quarter you had point balances below the averages and some of it\\'s the non-strategic runoff that Rob alluded to earlier but I\\'m just wondering in that context of being conscious about both rate risk and credit risk is any of this a conscious effort to either pull back from certain areas and what do you see about at least the competition/term structure in the environment today ?You said revenues were under more pressure . Is the sole reason due to lower rates for longer or are there some other contributing factors ? You mentioned more competition in commercial but that\\'s not new . For example maybe service charges on deposits are going to be worse than you thought before .And I guess you can\\'t really control the purchase accounting accretion . So if I heard you correctly , you\\'re guiding for negative operating leverage first and second and for the year and is that strictly due to purchase accounting accretion or is that just the tougher environment for longer ?Back to the competitive discussion and I think that Ken had brought up around commercial competition , I believe you have indicated in the past that you\\'re staying off the fairway to agree in commercial lending around mid-market C&I and CRE given the inability to get compelling enough returns . Is this still the case and are you continuing to emphasize the specialty businesses in terms of driving growth in your commercial books ?And then given that and given also what you indicated in auto right now given the competition for your loan growth expectation in the out quarters , I get what you say about next quarter but in the out quarters can you give us a little bit of color on how you\\'re thinking about growth ? Is it still something you would call or characterize as modest ?And then lastly – Iknow you indicated the concerns around how much in rate hikes we could actually see in 2015. Have you actually officially adopted a new internal expectation for rate hikes and if so what is that ?On your Legacy Asset Servicing , in your discussions you said that the loans went down from 36,000 loans in the quarter . Did you sell any loans in the quarter ?I know one of the things out there is what we\\'re seeing or hearing is that there\\'s a strong market right now forpeople wanting to buy either re-performing or non-performing loans . Are you going to use that as an advantage to start moving this stuff off your books quicker ?On the increased asset sensitivity , it sounds like more of the increased sensitivity came out on the long end . It\\'s great you make a lot more money if the curve shifts up 100 basis points but a lot of people are more fearful of what happens if we get into a flattener environment . Is it as simple as you capture at least half the benefit by short rates going up and if we\\'re in a flattener that\\'s where it ends ?In terms of if rates stay pretty flat , what kind of outlook would you have for the core NII if we take the $10.2 billion this quarter as a jumping off point ? Do have any room to lower the debt costs from here ? Or how would you expect the core NII to trend if we dont see too much movement on rates ? And that couple of hundred million over a couple of quarters , right ? And that\\'s just kind of core leakage from new stuff coming on at lower yields and you\\'re not investing much in a low rate environment ?On the discretionary portfolio and the switch out to HQLA . Can you give us a sense of just how much more of that mix shift we should expect , or at some point do you get to a point where the loan portfolio finally starts to bottomout ?Looking at the balance sheet , can you talk a little bit about the plans , kind of the level of excess cash ? I mean 22% of assets in cash , or 7% plus SLR ratio it would seem awfully tough to generate ROE or ROA with that much of the balance sheet sitting in cash . Is there something you can do there ?Could you also just clarify the comments about the NIM , in the second half of the year ? You\\'re selling some businesses and that\\'ll have an impact on NIM , but it sounded like there might be some actions you could take to mitigate that ?From a consolidated point of view , if you look at net interest income it was down about $500 million versus last quarter . Is that mostly the impact of FX and day count ?In terms of the outlook , you gave some color on the NIM down a couple bps potentially in 2Q , but we should pick up a day and then some balance sheet growth . Those net II dollars should be up , I guess as we think about 1Q to 2Q ?One of the dominant themes from Goldman last year was the very significant reduction in its balance sheet size , and so I\\'m wondering how – if we should be thinking about that differently at all at this stage given what you\\'re talking about with respect to client interests and demands , but relative to the capital constraints that were highlighted under this year\\'s CCAR , and I\\'m assuming were the genesis for today\\'s preferred offering . How should we think about all those dynamics with respect to balance sheet size ?It sounds like from your repricing commentary , you do see that at least on the margin occurring ?And then I know the loan growth environment is sort of tough , but sequential loan growth slowed somewhat and it looked like PLA slowed more than mortgage . Was there anything driving that ? And should we ratchet down expectations for loan growth ? Or was that more sort of like a single quarter type of a slow down there ?And then just lastly , on the Wealth Management side and specifically the new long-term deposit target of $200B which Greg spoke to at a recent investor conference . In the past , you’ve highlighted some metrics where maybe you’re under-penetrated relative to peers to help drive future growth , and was hoping in the context of this specific target whether you could highlight any specific metrics which would support that additional growth towards that $200B .You had mentioned earlier about long-term debt cost coming down and I think implied you’re still early on in that process . Maybe if you could just size how much benefit you’ve had so far from that and try and shape how much opportunity is still in front of us .And do you have what the blended rate of your long-term debt is , the $155B ?But just I mean conceptually , are we halfway through or still – I mean , your spreads have been coming in quite a bit , market rates have been coming down even just the past year here , so I would think there’s still a decent opportunity to bring those rates down .Just a couple quick follow-ups here . So just on the bank and the strong loan demand , is it reasonable to think that you could skew more towards loans ? And you’ve presented , I think , you’ve given kind of roughly 60% loans , the percentage of assets by 2016 end . Is that the optimal mix ? Or if the demand is there , can we see that mix look more kind of lending heavy ?You’ve clearly made progress in terms of your deposit mix . As we potentially anticipate a rising rate environment for the back half of the year , given what the regulators have done in terms of saying okay , here are the good deposits , here are the not-so-good deposits , how should we expect the pace and magnitude of retail deposit repricing or pass-through if the Fed does raise rates in H2 this year ?Question on the deposit shrinkage . You obviously finished the program you announced at Investor Day . I’m just wondering if you’re going to take it further , what the impact on revenues has been . And do you expect that the full benefit to NIM is already in Q2 or in Q2 numbers , or we’re going to see more benefit in Q3 from the actions you took ?And the NIM benefit should flow into Q3 as well ?In terms of your core loan growth , you mentioned that that’s up about 12% y-over-y . Can you give us a sense as to where that’s growing the strongest and where you’re seeing – perhaps where you’re seeing a bit more weakness within the core loan growth specifically .On the card loan side , it seemed like you saw a decent uptick this quarter . Are you starting to get past some of the runoff and seeing more of a core driver ?What type of mortgage loans are you adding ? Are these jumbo ? Are they fixed rate ?Are you choosing to add some mortgage loans instead of securities because you’ve got a smaller securities book than a lot of peers and it seems like there’s capacity to add there ?You were talking about deposit betas and for a lot of very good reasons expecting that deposit betas will be a little bit faster this time around . But could you round out the conversation as to how you’re thinking about how your NIM is going to traject in a rising rate scenario ? Because I’ve got a few questions on whether the deposit betas being a little faster means that the NIM trajectory is likely to be different from last time rates rose for you guys .Okay , because the last time rates rose , your NIM didn’t move up that much .Can you give us your mortgage duration and how far you’re willing to take it ?Could you just give us a little bit more on your confidence about the economic environment vs . the commentary about the tough competition out there . So , we know you guys are going to get a great benefit looking ahead from the averaging of the GE . So on , one , could you just kind of flesh out the pockets of loan growth that you continue to expect ? And then also , do you anticipate being able to at least be in the pole position to get some more of those GE assets ?As we enter potentially a rising rate environment in H2, one of your peers today mentioned anticipating a significantly more competitive environment for retail deposits given the regulators have essentially said there are good deposits and bad deposits this time around . And secondarily , they also mentioned entering new markets for the first time and de novo-ing .I guess the first question is , how should we expect Wells Fargo’s repricing to progress if rates actually rise on the short end ? Secondarily , given the impressive footprint that you’ve built , how would you defend that market sharing footprint against those that are aggressively trying to grow retail deposits , particularly for regulatory purposes ?A quick follow-up to the GE portfolio you did add this quarter , you mentioned that we need to consider the average balance impact . Are there any considerations on the average yield impact as you think about Q3?Part of the new compression that we’ve been seeing for so long has obviously been , in part , due to the excess liquidity that’s been getting parked at the Fed as deposit growth has significantly outpaced loan growth really at a system-wide level . But today , we saw one of your competitors reported decrease in deposits both sequentially and y-over-y while still putting up pretty solid loan growth , and you guys also saw your loan growth outpace your deposit growth this quarter .Do you think we’re at an inflection point where we’ll no longer see deposit growth continue to exceed loan growth ? And if so , does that suggest that we should begin to see some continued improvement in NIMs going forward ?Thank you . If I may , as a follow-up , the amount of liquidity that you’re holding at the Fed you mentioned fell this quarter from an all-time high of $291B , I believe , last quarter . Is it reasonable to expect that to continue to fall from here as you redeploy more of that into higher-yielding loans and securities ? And taking LCR into consideration and the constraints there , can you give us a sense for where we could see those balances go ?On the mortgage side , we saw rates go up , but the volumes have held in very strong . Some of that I think is the refi pipeline coming out of first quarter . Can you talk a little bit about what you’re seeing in the purchase market world ? Is it really starting to make a comeback ?Questions , one on other income and one on the Wealth business . You called out on other income that you had $426mm impact from the debt hedges . I just wanted to make sure I understood what that was driven by . I know you indicated rate moves . Just wanted to make sure I understand is that the long end of the curve . And does it have any relation to the fair value hedges that you put in the 10-Q , the $173mm ? So , wanted to make sure I understand how that works .Okay . So the net was $426mm , not the $426mm plus the $173mm from the fair value hedges in the 10-Q ?What was the amount of your debt hedge loss in Q2? You mentioned that other income is down $426mm . Was that the amount of the debt hedge loss or is it different ?You mentioned repricing in Wholesale businesses , what are you doing there as it relates to your market sensitive revenues ?On the loan growth expectations , if I look at the core loan growth , it’s growing about – excluding the GE transaction and runoff – it’s growing at about almost four times the nominal GDP , which would be at the higher end of the historical norm . So I just want to make sure I understand , John , your comments about expectations of maybe some incremental leverage across both commercial and consumer , but I wonder to what extent it may , in fact , that may already be occurring and the GDP number will move to reflect that rather than an acceleration in loan growth ?On the noninterest margin . As we think about the trajectory from here , assuming rates don’t increase , what should the path of the NIM be ?On the commercial loan yields , looks like they were up pretty solidly , 7% to 8% – or 7BPS to 8BPS or so for the quarter . Just want to see if we could get a little bit of color on what drove that .On the home equity portfolio . Just wondered if you can give us an update there as we’re seeing some of the lines exit their draw periods . Wanted to see how those credits have been performing and if you’re seeing any migration there .Do you know how much – what percentage of your 2005 originations may have been refi-ed already or worked out ?You talked about the duration of the balance sheet . And you’re doing that through swaps and through investment portfolio purchases . Can you give us a feel for half a year , six months , is it nine months ? And how far do you want to go in the duration of the portfolio or the overall balance sheet ? So how far are we along that process ?And would you see any more lengthening in the near term , given the steepness of the yield curve now , gives you an opportunity to kind of productively use that to your advantage ?On the extension of the duration of the balance sheet this quarter with the use of interest rate swaps . Could you provide some more details on why you’re increasing your duration at this point in the cycle ? Is it a change in your view on whether you want to be patient for higher rates or is there some other reason why you want to extend duration now ?Is there anything specific that you’re seeing that has changed your view in the last six months ?On mortgage , JPMorgan Chase reported a very strong production quarter in jumbo mortgages this morning . And how are you guys positioned in that market and what percentage or rough percentage of your production are jumbos ?You indicated the upside that you have in the event of a rate rise ,$3.9 billion , if the parallel shift is 100 basis points . The question is how you\\'re thinking aboutdropping that to the bottom line . Is there reinvestments that would take up some of that , or are you at sufficientrun rate andinvestment spend that you would be able to drop more to the bottom line ?If we look at the core net interest income ex . the market related marks , it was down a little bitversus last quarter but you\\'re starting to see the loans inflect as you mentioned earlier . Do we start seeing stability in the core net interest income looking at the next quarter or two , or do we really need higher short-term rates for that ?On the discretionary book , you mentioned it came down a little bit when you look at it on a combined securities , mortgages basis . And I guess just we saw long-term rates go up and some banks have been increasing the discretionary book with higher reinvestment rates or higher investment rates here . What\\'s the thought on bringing that book down as rates have gone up ?On the NIM outlook , last quarter you mentioned that the yield curve stayed where it was , you\\'d have about $600 million of drag on NII over the next few quarters . Are you saying that that\\'s pretty much changed with the steepening of the curve since April when you spoke last , and not only NII is growing but NIM should stabilize , or is it just sort of offsetting each other , or are you getting a boost from that ? How do we think about the yield curve versus your prior comment ?The $3.9 billion of sensitivity to higher rates , how much is FAS 91 related versus sort of core ?On the rate sensitivity , the $3.9 billion move , for a 100 basis point parallel move , I assume that illustration is to a 100 basis point move , that\\'s a shock or an instantaneous move in rates . Can you give us any feel for how that number would change if the move in rates is more gradual ? The Fed is kind of saying probably go gradually . How does that change if it\\'s not instantaneous ?On the average balance sheet . When you look at the debt securities line , the yield went up some version of a lot , from 2% to 3.2%. I\\'m assuming some of that is LAS loans converting . But could you give a little color on what that drives that ? Because the overall size of those book didn\\'t change that much .Inside the C&I book , the U .S . commercial book , it was just a 4 basis point drop quarter-on-quarter , but there\\'s growth there . So I\\'m just curious , the trade off between price and yield give up on the new loans you\\'re putting on versus the responsible growth you talked about . Doesn\\'t seem that bad , I\\'m just curious on what kind of yield you\\'re putting new loans on .It looked like the core loan growth coming out of the institutional bank and the wealth management looked strong . But the – I\\'m still unclear what the core level of growth was inside theconsumer organization . And so I\\'m just try ing to reconcile that with where the incremental hiring is occurring on the sales front ? So could you just clarify what the core level of consumer growth was ?And so do you have a sense or is there some sense maybe Brian you can give us to – how that investment in sort of front office staff is contributing to growth outside of the segment ?If we divorced just the runoff from some of the legacy assets that\\'s still occurring , would you expect the core consumer asset growth to accelerate as a consequence of this investment , or do you think that it\\'s currently run rating ?On asset and liability management , when you look at the market adjustments if you had of $669 million this quarter , as rates go up there\\'s less and less impact from that . How much is remaining in the next 50 basis points in just the prepayment speed slowing down ?And then when you\\'re talking about the being able to see the margin go up in the back half of theyear because of the current steepness of the yield curve , does that include some utilization in a sense of increasing your securities portfolio while you invest some of the liquid assets you have on the balance sheet ?Any general range ? $10 billion , $20 billion , $30 billion ? Any kind of rule of thumb there ?When you look at your trading activity , typically in the past when I had a trading activity in the bank that I was managing , when you have a steepening of the yield curve , you get some pickup because you\\'re getting the current long-term yield funded by short-term rate . The rate on the trading activity account did not go up this quarter , but averaging into the next quarter , would you expect some benefit there ? I\\'m just more focused on the steepness versus the flattening of the yield curve . A steeper yield curve typically brings a little better spread on the trading account .Guy s , just another liquidity issue . Could you just tell us what\\'s on deposit , what excess deposits you\\'ve gotwith the Fed now and what your plans are for those going forward ?And my second question is for Bill . We’ve been asking your peers over the past few calls in terms of their take on deposit betasand hopeful anticipation of a rising rate environment in the back half of this year . JPMorgan mentioned that they think that the betas are going to be much greater because of regulatory – new regulatory standards .Wells took a softer stance saying that we’re coming from zero and USB was somewhere down the middle . Where do you stand ?And then , maybe just another question on , kind of , how you are thinking about the margin and balance sheet growth dynamics here as we look for stable NII into Q3. So I appreciate your updated thoughts on the purchase accounting down – I think it’s down $200mm . But as you look at things ,is margin pressure abating in part because of that , which allows you to do NII , or are you thinking you’ll grow the balance sheet perhaps within a more rapid clip ?How do you see the interplay coming out ?Can you just talk about the desire to deploy some of the liquidity ? Last quarter , I know you added to the securities book , but if we look over a longer-term period it doesn’t seem like you’ve kind of built the securities or mortgage book as much as we’ve seen some other banks . And , obviously , rates have backed up a little bit here , so just curious on thoughts of easing into it around these levels .We’ve heard on a couple of calls the challenges that a lot of the banks are seeing in terms of generating loan growth on the commercial side . And I know that you all feel quite comfortable being able to bring more of the fee income component to these relationships ,so that you’re not just sort of chasing rate . But can you give us an outlook on sort of how you’re thinking about commercial loan growth specifically within the C&I space , and I guess , also sort of where the M&A financing outlook might be to drive further growth in the commercial side of things ?Okay . All right . And then , Bill , getting back to your comments you just made around competition in the mid-market space in C&I . And I know you’ve been talking about that and it certainly sounds like it’s still competitive . So my question is , from your perspective , what changes that ? I mean , does the – as the size of the pie grows and demand improves across the board here ,does that allow you to step back in ?Or are you skeptical of that as well ?Hey , can you go back a little bit on the follow-up question on the competition out there ? You define yourselves as middle market type of bank . Can you define what really middle market is , because I think it has different definitions for different people ?And then , just a second question on investment securities . So you guys are in good shape on LCR .And we see that you have been building .When I look at the core interest – net interest margin ,obviously , there’s still the negative rollover effect of 11BPS on the investment securities . How are new investments coming on vs . what’s on the balance sheet ?And are we getting closer to kind of that stabilization with the rates up a little bit ?Right . But to your point , your front book back book is getting better ?Can you guys discuss the quality of the money market and demand deposit growth that you saw this quarter from an LCR perspective ? And on a related note , on the initiatives that some banks have undertaken to de-emphasize non-operating deposits , do you have any thoughts on where those deposits are going ?If I can squeeze one last one in , relating to – just to followup on your comments surrounding– around the deployment of your excess liquidity . One of your peers indicated yesterday that the 10-year U .S . Treasuriesat around 2.5%, represented an attractive asset in the rate environment that we find ourselves in and they were comfortable extending duration a little bit .You mentioned , Bill , that your securities balances should start to rise from here as you step your way into higherrate environment . Does that mean that you’re also feeling a little bit more comfortable extending duration on than you did , say , a quarter two ago ?Thank you . Rob , I wanted to go back to the deposit beta discussion . The characterization of JPMorgan is a little bit [ph] skewed(56:52) in the sense that Jamie did come back yesterday and said , look , there’s gamma , which means , early on , the deposit betas are going to be much different than , let’s say , after the first 50BPS to 100BPS . So I just wanted to kind of re-context that for you and ask more specifically , what happens initially vs . maybe what happens generally over the whole rate increase ? So think about the first 50BPS first .Well , could you – let me ask you another way . Can you condition the way will posture yourself ? In other words , we get a 25-basis-point move in the Fed Funds rate , will you be proactively moving your rates higher ?Or will you react to what the market changes ? So if you don’t see any outflow of deposits , will you then ...Just to follow up on two issues very quickly as we wrap up the call here . One , Rob , I just wanted to make sure I understood your commentary about loan growth across the newer geographies . It seems like the – sort of the run rate for the industry is somewhere in the sort of 6% to 8% annualized level . But did I understand your commentary to mean that it’s in line with that off of a low base ? Because intuitively , it seemed like it should be somewhat greater than the industry average , just given ...On the timing and the puts and takes . You mentioned OneMain being the late third quarter hopeful . Can the debt repurchase coincide with that ? How long of a delay there ? And then alsoCostco coming in; I\\'m just more of timing the good guidance you have given us on the puts and takes on the NIM in the back half and going into next year .Within North America retail banking , you mentioned the deposit spreads were improving , and that was a key driver of the revenue . What\\'s driving the better deposit spreads ? Is that just mix , or what is that exactly ?Looking at International Consumer loan growth , it looks like trends are pretty good , ex-Korea and just wondering sort of what your outlook was there ?On the Citi Holdings assets; I think you said that Citi Holdings is now 6% of total assets , and it looks like from the footnote it\\'s more like 13% of your risk-weighted assets , so it looks like the risk-weighted assets in Citi Holdings are not coming down as fast as total assets . Do you think that kind ofrelationship will continue , and is it related to any particular type of asset in Citi Holdings ?With the wind down of Citi Holdings and how that impacts risk-weighted assets because you mentioned the $34 billion , which you have basically got baked in , and you just touched on the relationshipbetween the GAAP assets and the RWA . So if we were to be looking at what is going to happen to the $1.279 billion of RWA you had fully-phased at the end of the secondquarter ? I mean , obviously I would imagine that a  minimum would be $34 billion coming off that pro forma . And I suppose th e question I\\'m asking is how muchmore might come off in respect to the uplift between the GAAP assets and RWA ? And also perhaps how much you think you might use in actually growing the business during that period ? You ended your prepared remarks saying the world changed in 2008, you cut costs , you implemented regulation and the implication is others are now catching up , implying a little more rational pricing , which You’ve said on prior calls . Can you just give us a description of the areas where you\\'re seeing the biggest repricing or the areas that you\\'re watching the most ?Would you call this as an increase in your cost of goods sold that you\\'re passing on to customers ?And last follow up on this . Can you give a sense of magnitude ? Are we talking basis point or tens of basis points or what ?This is more of an accounting question . Basically , your Investment Banking was up quarter-over-quarter , commissions and fees were up , your principal transactions were up , and obviously there was a big jump in your debt underwriting . And yet there was almost a $200 million drop in your net interest income . And I\\'m just wondering why that would be ? what are the accounting recognition that would allow that to happen ?But the market making in the FICC side of the business was down 49% so…And then just one more thing that was topical for investors during the quarter based on your 10-Q , and I know you addressed it a little bit at your conference a few weeks ago , but maybe you can talk a little bit about the decline in interest rate sensitivity that was evident in your Q , the degree to which that might have reflected just a difference in asset deployment strategy , securities vs . loans , whatever , and whether there are any risk management elements that we need to think about with respect to the change there .My first question’s on Wealth Management . You said you have $140B of deposits of what’s left to redeploy , and we estimate a Wealth Management net interest margin of 2%. What would you consider a normal NIM for that business ?Yeah , what is your NIM in the Wealth Management business ? We’re estimating 2%, but if you want to clarify that , but what do you think is a normal margin for lending in Wealth Management ?So where do you hope the 23% ratio to go over time ?Most of my questions have been answered , but I had a follow-up . I think I asked it last quarter . The amount of long-term debt you have coming through the next 12 months; there’s a good disclosure here showing it’s $27B . But what’s the difference in the long-term debt rate that’s on the balance sheet vs . what you get on new issuance ? Obviously rates have come down . The two-notch upgrade helps . How much revenue benefit or reduction in interest expense occurs as debt rolls off and you get to reissue at a lower rate ?My question was pretty similar to Matt . Just if you can give us sort of an update of where you are in your target of reducing funding costs by 25% in the context of the debt issuance conversation ? Are we close ? 50% of the way ? Just so you can give us a sense of how much more we can expect on the lower funding costs .But you don’t want to give us , like , you’re 50% of the way there , 75% of the way there ?Jon , maybe a question for you on the Wealth Management loan growth and deposit growth now that the Citi transfers are effectively done . What are you expecting for deposit growth within the bank and what are you expecting for the growth rate , particularly within the retail side of the loan growth in Wealth Management ? It’s been running about 40% annualized . Is – other than just the fact that the denominator is growing , is there any reason to think that that would slow at any point over the next six to 12 months ?Just in terms of your expectations for deposit growth now that the Citi transfers are done .On the Institutional loan –Institutional Securities loan portfolio , that’s actually growing in some cases faster than in the Wealth Management side of things . But I found it interesting that the percentage of the loans that are investment-grade are also growing . Can you give us a little more color as to where you’re seeing opportunities within the Institutional Securities portfolio ?Is the economy getting stronger or weaker ? And the reason I ask that , the jobs report from a couple weeks ago seems to imply the economy is getting softer . Yet , your loan growth actually – your core loan growth accelerated , and you’re guiding for faster loan growth in Q4. So is there noise in that loan growth figure ? Or is the economy , based on what you’re seeing , getting stronger , and the jobs number is misleading ?On NII and NIM , you said it would be relatively flat in Q4, yet you’re still expecting some pretty strong loan growth . I just want to , if you can , maybe discuss why you think it would remain flat in that scenario . And maybe a bit longer term in an environment where we’re looking at lower for longer potentially in the rates , how do we think about the NIM a little bit over the immediate term ?On expenses , over the past two quarters , your adjusted overhead ratio was 58% to 60%. You noted that you think that net interest income could grow next year even if rates stay low . Could you potentially slide below the 58% to 60% band that you reported over the past two quarters relative to – you mentioned an efficiency target of 55% if rates actually normalize ?We’ve seen some assets change hands , and you guys have been mentioned as the buyer for some of the other assets that are out there . Just wondering on what the ability and appetite is out there to buy loans .You mentioned that you’ve built out 400 new relationships in the middle market area of the Commercial Bank . But when we look at the loans outstanding , you’re essentially flat on a y-over-y basis , whereas the corporate client business has grown very rapidly . Can you give us some more color behind what’s driving those numbers ?On the Mortgage Banking side , I noticed that your residential loans on your balance sheet have grown . Are they mostly jumbos ? And are they coming out of your normal production , that $29B , and you’re selling less to the government ? Can you add some color around those numbers ?And then are they mainly ARM loans , or are they fixed rate loans ?Your asset yields jumped this quarter , which was good to see of course . Can you share with us how the Fed funds rate went up as much as it did sequentially ? And also , your securities yield went up in the quarter sequentially . Can you give us some color behind both those numbers ?

And then , maybe you could talk about what you’ve got baked in for next year’s outlook and give us some indication as to what the plans are in the event that they don’t come through as you’re currently budgeting for .I was hoping you could spend a second talking – or kind of expanding upon your comments on the rate situation , if indeed we’re going to be lower for potentially a lot longer . Does that change any of the way you’ve been thinking about managing the balance sheet ? For example , capital hit could be less of an issue if rates are going to stay low . So , does that change your thoughts on the securities portfolio ? Could you sort of extend out with swaps , stuff like that ?If I could follow up on the balance sheet question , honing in both on the liquidity but also just broadening it out , you’ve got a lot of liquidity , a lot of deposits , a lot of capital , not as many loans relative to your balance sheet as peers . And I get that you don’t want to add $34B of securities all at once or even kind of over the next several quarters . But what are you thinking about on the loan book , what you can do there , maybe strategically , a little different to deploy some of that liquidity and boost the revenues over time ?Yeah , I think it’s that upside optionality that I was really kind of trying to get at . I mean if you had to rank in terms of like why loan growth , is it weak demand , bad pricing , concern on the terms ? I’m sure it’s a combination of all three , but like what would the pecking order be ?Just back to the loan growth question again , I know in the past you’ve alluded to the focus on loan , some of the loan-only relationships you had . And accordingly , you were a little bit more cautious in growing your pure mid-market type of relationships if you couldn’t secure the fees . So , can you just update us ? Is that conservative posture or that approach at all still impacting your loan growth at all in the commercial bucket ?Just a couple of quick cleanups , if you don’t mind . So , again , staying away from the next year full year , but just coming back to , Bill , your comments about without rates , kind of tough to grow . NII , assuming you’re talking about kind of an all-in basis , Rob , do you just have kind of a – even to help us out understand the expected the PAA decline next year for the $180mm to $200mm that you’re expecting for this year ?So if we just start – I guess if we just start it at the – ending at [ph] $70mm and I ran that across $280 million versus [ph] $300mm .Just a – first of all , Rob maybe a question for you , a question on – loan commitments appear to be growing a little bit faster than loans . I’m curious if there’s any specific areas where those are growing faster . You’ve mentioned commercial real estate being an area where you’re making some good momentum in terms of loan growth , but just curious if I’m right suggesting that commercial real estate is an area where you’re growing commitments . And I guess to Bill’s earlier comment about generating fee revenue off that , how successful have you been with those new relationships in terms of driving fee income ?Rob , and then my follow up really is on the interest-bearing costs , those are up a couple of basis points q-over-q . Is there anything you’re doing on the deposit side in terms of targeting specific areas or certain products that is pushing that cost of debt – of interest-bearing liabilities up ?Some of the banks that have reported so far , are showing loan growth outpaced deposit growth . And more broadly , we’ve recently also started seeing that dynamic in the [ph] HA (44:14) data . However , you guys continue to generate a very healthy deposit growth in excess of your loan growth . Do you have any thoughts on what may be driving that ?Understood . And then finally , if I can , a related longer term question , Bill , on competition for deposits . Some believe that the industry’s core loan to deposit ratio is higher than what it would appear to be on a reported basis once you factor in deposit outflow risk under LCR . And with that recent [ph] H (48:15) data dynamic that we talked about showing loan growth now outpacing deposit growth across the large banks , do you think there is a chance that we could actually start to see competition for deposits intensify a bit , independent of the Fed raising rates ?Yeah . Bill , you’ve been the only CEO thus far who said we’re disappointed with the Feds failure to raise rates . I think you said the same thing , as I recall , in Boston about three years ago . You’ve been one of the more forthright , I think , and not necessarily criticizing , but certainly calling it to everyone’s attention . We know what it’s doing to the banking industry . But could you just give us your perspective on what ZIRP is doing to the rest of the economy ?So when they do decide to move , and let’s assume it’s 25BPS which seems to be the consensus , does it make any difference ?Any further duration extension on the asset structure , given the outlook that rates will stay lower for longer ? Do you think the U .S . economy is getting better or worse , I guess ? I\\'m hearing , on the one hand , John , you\\'re mentioning some additional confidence in some areas , and on the other hand , you\\'re mentioning the global economy as being a headwind , so which is it ? Is the U .S . economy getting better or worse ?I just wanted to follow up on that last comment , you believe you\\'re in a lower for longer rate environment . Since adding these assets has the same impact of extending duration on the asset side , should we expect cash balances to stay relatively stable from the average balances of the third quarter ?On\\xa0some of\\xa0the\\xa0changes\\xa0in\\xa0the\\xa0loan\\xa0yields\\xa0within\\xa0the\\xa0commercial\\xa0buckets .\\xa0A\\xa0few\\xa0of\\xa0them\\xa0like\\xa0commercial\\xa0mortgage ,\\xa0construction\\xa0and leasing ,\\xa0they\\xa0come\\xa0under\\xa0a\\xa0little\\xa0more\\xa0pressure\\xa0than\\xa0I\\xa0would\\'ve\\xa0thought .\\xa0I\\xa0imagine ,\\xa0at\\xa0least\\xa0to\\xa0a certain\\xa0extent\\xa0that\\'s\\xa0due\\xa0to\\xa0both the\\xa0financing\\xa0and\\xa0the\\xa0GE\\xa0deals ,\\xa0but\\xa0was\\xa0curious\\xa0to\\xa0get\\xa0your\\xa0color\\xa0and\\xa0thoughts\\xa0on\\xa0kind\\xa0of\\xa0what\\xa0might\\xa0be\\xa0going\\xa0on\\xa0there .On the loan yield topic , just based on your answer there , are you implying that that commercial yield decline of 15 basis points that we saw this quarter could actually snap back next quarter ?On\\xa0the\\xa0margin , the swaps –\\xa0I\\xa0just\\xa0want\\xa0to\\xa0get\\xa0an\\xa0idea\\xa0of\\xa0how\\xa0much\\xa0the\\xa0swaps\\xa0benefited\\xa0the\\xa0margin\\xa0in\\xa0the\\xa0quarter\\xa0and\\xa0then\\xa0also\\xa0your\\xa0appetite\\xa0to\\xa0add\\xa0incremental\\xa0swaps [inaudible]\\xa0(54:04).On the jumbo loan market , we\\'re seeing more and more market share go to the jumbo markets . Can you add more color around that ? And then on the loans that you put on your portfolio , my guess is most of them are jumbos . And when do you feel that you\\'re going to be filled up there ?Can you just elaborate on why the NIM will be down five to 10 basis points , what the assumed timing of the OneMain and balance sheet restructuring as part of that ?I think the outlook for 4Q is for the net interest margin percent to be down five to 10 basis points , and there are obviously a lot of moving pieces that\\'s going to impact that . But how do we think about core NIM overlaying the impact of OneMain , the debt restructuring ? I\\'m trying to figure out if it\\'s down that much because of those transactions . Or is that down that much on a core basis ?As we think about the exit level of this year of the net interest margin , essentially a good 1Q 2016 level , holding rates , holding mix , and holding all that steady , how would that NIM compare to the current third quarter NIM or what you\\'re expecting in 4Q ?How much does getting where you want to be or , achieving your targets , depend on higher U .S . interest rates ?On\\xa0the\\xa0debt\\xa0buyback\\xa0front ,\\xa0can\\xa0you\\xa0help\\xa0us\\xa0understand\\xa0just\\xa0how\\xa0much\\xa0the\\xa0benefit\\xa0was\\xa0this\\xa0quarter ,\\xa0and\\xa0if\\xa0the\\xa0premise\\xa0of\\xa0doing\\xa0more\\xa0in\\xa0the\\xa0future\\xa0is\\xa0also\\xa0baked\\xa0into\\xa0your\\xa0expectation\\xa0for\\xa0the\\xa0future\\xa0NIM ?Yes , and was that a modest benefit this quarter ? You didn\\'t really see [debt buybacks] benefit in the cost of debt on the liability side of the average balance sheet page , so just wondering how much benefit you could still get from that going forward .On the U .S . credit card environment , you mentioned that the two years forward is when with the new accounts you get to a better lending environment obviously because at first you get the new accounts in , and then they spend , and then they borrow . I just wanted to understand . Was that two years to what you think is average run rate in borrowing or in revolving for the accounts that you\\'re looking for , or is that when you start to see the beginnings of borrowings ? I\\'m just trying to understand what the two-year number was about .On loan growth and so your outlook into the fourth quarter . I guess following up on an earlier comment , [it seems like that while there are continued growth expectations across many of your international markets , those growth expectations are coming down], and you reported core loan growth in Citicorp as being at about mid-single digit . [Are you expecting core loan growth to continue at mid-single-digit levels over the next quarter or two , or are there markets where you think that that could slow down substantially ?]It seems as if the overall set of dynamics is some rebasing of NIM because of change in asset mix and a fairly constant efficiency ratio given the challenges of revenue generation and reinvestment . And putting aside maybe some of the volatility in capital markets , it seems then that the primary lever on the income statement for some acceleration in earnings is therefore asset generation . Is that correct ?And so within that , I just want to make sure I understand . It seems as if what you\\'re pointing to as the primary drivers of incremental asset generation , meaning beyond the current run rate trend , are Card in the U .S ., retail loan in International Consumer , and Treasury , TSS , and Private Bank in ICB . Is that broadly correct by category ?In Corporate Banking , is there any reason to expect some change in trend line there on a few- quarter view from an asset generation perspective ?Can you give us an update on the bank deposit and lending strategy ? You obviously announced a deal to acquire some deposits and had a key hire in the lending side , I think , in the second quarter . So just give us an update on what you\\'re thinking there and will we see this business grow to be meaningful at some point ?On the funding side , as we think about the deposits growing over time , is that something that\\'ll benefit you in downturns or is it also something that\\'ll benefit the earnings incrementally from lower funding costs ?Your balance sheet was up to a level we haven\\'t seen in a over a year . I think the balance sheet was up $20 billion plus quarter-over-quarter , yet it was a volatile environment . You look like you pulled back on risk , at least in the VaR . Can you kind of just help me think through that ? You didn\\'t close on the deposit franchise acquisition this quarter , third quarter .On the deposit strategy , you mentioned that was all about the funding diversification . So if you look at the second quarter , deposits were about 12% of total liabilities . What percentage that need to get to for you to consider that to be your – to reach your diversification levels that you want ?Do you anticipate that there would be some benefit on interest expense over time as you take off short-term borrowings ?On the Merchant Banking business when we look at that business and maybe the overall portfolio , I just want to get a sense on like the mix of the assets that are in there . And then it sounds like on the Asia fund you didn\\'t go under the high water market or the hurdle . So it was just a negative environment , so you take the hit and you get the negative carry . But going forward , if the investments are positive , there\\'s nothing that we should be thinking about it differently , meaning if it\\'s positive , we\\'ll see the positive carry return . But really , I want to understand like the mix of that business because when we\\'re in more volatile environments , we can see some quarters where some weird things happen . So any color you can provide there .On Wealth Management , you guys saw deposits grow this quarter . Was there anything specific driving that ? And then when we think about the loan-to-deposit ratio , as you guys continue to show nice growth in the loan book . How should we frame loan growth and where the loan book could get to , based on that ?On the Wealth Management net interest income , where in the previous couple of quarters , certainly Q2, you mentioned the realization of the forward curve in your investment securities portfolio as being a factor . I dont know if you can talk us through Q3, Q2, in that respect , within the Wealth Management net interest income . And on the supplementary leverage exposure , well the SLR , and the total exposure number . It seems to have gone down . I mean , is there some add – have you been successful on reducing add-ons or I think in the past you talked about securities financing . I just wonder if you could talk a bit about that strategy . Thank you .I was wondering if you could talk to us a little bit about the benefits from rates as they come through . Obviously , your commentary that NII will be even flattish in Q1 adjusted for day count and even with some securities gains in the numbers this quarter presumes a nice helper from that first move . You guys were really conservative on your deposit beta thoughts when you had talked about them previously . I know probably you haven’t seen much change yet . But how are you expecting the deposit payer to act ? And has there been any change to your modeling expectations about what might come through as we get through the first couple of hikes ?Marianne , if I can just clarify your NII comment from the very beginning of the call , do I understand correctly that the $2B of incremental NII that you’ve cited is just a function of the repricing dynamics as they move through your balance sheet , or is there also I guess a contribution from loan growth ?Great , thank you . And so I know we just touched on RWAs , but how do you suggest we think about GAAP assets for this year ?If we look at credit spreads in the bond market , even ex-energy , they’ve widened considerably . And I’m wondering if this has resulted in wholesale credit being repriced at all . I realize the bond market doesn’t set bank loan pricing , but just wondering if you’ve been able to reprice some of the wholesale customers or expect being able to do so .I guess I wonder why , like we saw pricing in the debt markets come in considerably over the last several years . C&I pricing came in . I realize it might take some time , but I would think there’s the opportunity for at least some repricing around the edges , no ?Jamie , to follow up on your comments about maybe some better pricing in prime brokerage and repo because of the capital requirements requiring you guys to raise prices , can you expand upon that ? Do you see it growing where you could get even better pricing going forward because of less competition ? Can you give just more color there ?And then last follow-up , and maybe this is back to you , Mike . One theory that was put out there is that we are in a vicious cycle of liquidity , not due to Citigroup , not due to the banks , but you have a lot of bond investors that have invert , whether it’s junk bond or private equity or liquidity funds . And to the extent that liquidity dries up , you could have pressure on some of your borrowers even though it’s not due to you . Do you think we’re in a vicious cycle of liquidity ? Are you seeing any evidence of that ?Just one question , John . I believe you were talking about – still seeing the ability to grow Corp revenues this year , and I’m just presuming you’re talking constant dollar basis . So I was just wondering , just obviously a lot of uncertainties that we can caveat , but as it stands now , how much do you expect rates to inform that growth , and how would you break the growth potential between NII and the fee side ?And then one question just on balance sheet size . Still think it’s coming out of the averages after the sales this quarter and the pending sales going forward . Do you have some type of view on where average earning assets balances out ? Where the kind of settle out point is after you work through the last part or the lingering parts of what you’re planning on getting rid of ?I was thinking more of overall firm because I would presume that Holdings kind of just dwindles back to the point where at some point you just put it back into the overall firm but just – I’m thinking more just big picture , top of the house .We’ll see a little bit of push-out but you’re not necessarily seeing a major shrinkage and you would give yourself room for it to grow again . You’re not capped out .And then just one quick piggyback question on the NIM guidance . John , you mentioned that any rate benefit , which sounds like it will be relatively modest as contemplated within the guidance for 2016, can be offset by a reduction in trading NII . I just wanted to get a sense as to what’s driving that . Is it a function of lower inventory levels , issuance tied to TLAC or is it something else ?One quick balance sheet question . You talked about the debt buyback as a consequence of the OneMain sale and the fact that you have so little non-operational deposits left . At this stage , is there any real balance sheet optimization opportunity left to you , or have those been largely exhausted ?I’m anticipating that investors will be curious about what you mean by adjust accordingly . I mean , as you can imagine , investors are a little bit more cautious about the pace of the Fed .And as you think about the trade-off between delivering positive operating leverage if the Fed doesn’t raise three times , vs . delaying some of the investments that you mentioned , I guess is the adjusting accordingly on the expense side ? Or just take us through your potential – yes .Just want – similar to the line of questioning . In terms of how we should think about spread revenue growth and the margin outlook , could you just give us some way to think about the sensitivity if we don’t see any Fed moves ? What we could think – what we could expect by way of the margin progression as well as spread breadth ?And then separately , in terms of how we should think about loan growth beyond Q1, I know you indicated relatively stable for Q1 2016, but what’s – how are you thinking about full-year , particularly given some of the uncertainty on the macro backdrop ?Rob , can you share with us in terms of what you’re seeing on the underwriting standards in commercial real estate and construction loans or what your loan guys are telling you ? And second , has there been any change in those underwriting standards in the marketplace since the regulators came out in December , expressing concerns that those standards are too aggressive ?And then in your press release in the Corporate & Institutional Banking section , you guys gave us some color . You’ve talked about the loans growing about 1% over Q3 and it was due to some real estate and business credit that you generated as well as large corporate . But then you had put in there partially offset by the impact of capital and liquidity management activities . Can you give us some color what that was ?And not to put words in your mouth , so if it’s not meeting your internal return targets , you’re willing to give this business up . Is that correct ?And then finally , Rob , I apologize if you addressed this in your prepared remarks and I didn’t hear it . But going into Q1, I know you showed us that the net interest income will be up slightly . You saw the increase in your margin this quarter . Would the Fed funds rate increase that we saw in December , should that have a positive impact on the net interest margin in Q1?Bill , a couple of questions ago , you talked about the potential benefit of dislocation on your specialty businesses . I guess pricing gets out of whack , the risk-reward improves , et cetera . I wonder if you could sort of apply those comments to the broader portfolio . Are you seeing anything thus far , just given the dislocation which , I guess , for now has been largely limited to the capital markets ? But are you seeing anything in the broader portfolio that would lead you to feel better about [indiscernible] (34:44).I know in your past guidance that you’ve been somewhat bullish , and I think you were calling for like 200BPS of rate hikes . Has the volatility over the last – if you answered this question , I really apologize . I’ve been jumping all over the place . But has the volatility in the markets over the last two weeks changed those assessments ?And then just more broadly speaking , I mean obviously it’s a very balanced loan portfolio and , as you mentioned , consumer-heavy , if anything . But any thoughts on how much more improvement there still to come on the consumer side ? I mean , assuming maybe the macro either holds or just has a soft patch overall , is there still some embedded improvement that we could see , I guess , really in the real estate portfolios on the consumer side ?And then separately on the spread revenue side , you indicated that net interest income should grow . It could exceed the 4% growth that you saw in 2015 if you get hikes . How many hikes are you assuming and how much greater than the 4% could it be ?Then lastly , what would that mean in terms of the margin outlook if you do get under those hike scenarios [indiscernible] (36:05)?Does the decision by one of your large competitors to pass the 25-basis-point increase through to their commercial depositors influence at all how you guys view the degree to which you and others in the industry will benefit from higher rates ?And then in 2015, especially in H2, we saw on the macro data , and I think even on your micro data , a big pickup in purchase originations , probably Q3 is the largest origination quarter for purchases since 2007, 2008. Do you think TRID interrupted that ? Are you still seeing very strong demand for the purchase market despite all this volatility ?And then , on the net interest margin , can we just think about , let’s forget about the funding costs and deposits because everybody’s skittish on committing to what’s going to happen given the dynamic of competition , but let’s just think about earning assets and the floating loans and short-term liquid assets that you have . With the 25 basis point rise that we saw in December , how much should we see the impact on net positive to earning asset yields , just isolating out that one piece of the equation ?One quick follow-up on the NII . Is there a benefit from the pay down of trust preferreds that you’ll get in 2016? And is that why you’re able to grow the core NII a little bit in 2016?And so it’s really just the loan growth and pretty stable rates driving some core NII growth ?On your NPAs , you have really good disclosure . You’re getting it down to 103,000 units . Did you sell any this quarter , or was that all the workouts through your servicing ?And then when do you – I mean , like , at this the point , when do you think you can get that down to – I guess it’s not a normal level because you’re just going to run this whole portfolio off . Can you have any idea when that will be over with ?Maybe just a quick question on deposit beta since the rate hike . Have you seen anything unusual ? I would assume it would be more on the institutional side where you would see movement at this point . And then maybe you can give some update on how you’re thinking about the deposit betas this year .And you still think that makes sense or do you think that’s relatively conservative ?I think you put the heat on a little bit on loan growth over the last couple of quarters . And if you look at lending in your primary lending segments , it’s picked up , and I think that’s good . The question I have is with new information that we have , I mean , the market’s digesting and anticipating – I don’t know if I’ll call it a recession , but a lot of fear around recession , on lower oil and China-related fears . The question I have is if you look at the core loan growth , are you still okay running it at this level ? Do you feel like your customer base that you’re making these new loans to are a little more insulated to the world that the market is fearful of ?Just a quick follow-up on the loan growth side . I know you talked about the credit quality underneath the Commercial side , but after a 13%, 14% loan growth year , do you think you can maintain that type of pace of growth given some of the concerns we’ve seen underlying even if quality is holding up ? So just I guess your general outlook for loan growth rates and can it match or maintain what you did last year ?Continue to be driven by Commercial , would you say ?No , that’s fair , that’s fair . Thanks , James . I guess , is there any way that we could think about revenue or you could maybe help us to frame how to think about revenue ? Because , obviously , if you’re going to take that much capital outright , you’re going to have a very different business . You talked about focusing on some of the strengths , a few business lines . Maybe you could help us think about which businesses you’re going to be deemphasizing and how much revenue you think realistically could come out as a result of that and then , finally , how that translates into margin for the business overall .And then , just a follow-up question on Wealth Management . Looking at your slide 16, the net interest income growth in a range of 75BPS to 175BPS of margin contribution , if – I seem to remember that you’ve baked in the forward curve to those assumptions . So , where would we be in terms of that range , if short-term interest rates stay where they are currently as opposed to actually incorporating the forward curve ?And then my follow-up , just on the lending balances , I’m just trying to reconcile the current target vs . the prior target . So , you had – you expected $180B in total U .S . bank assets by the end of 2016. Does that still stand ? And then , how do we think of 2017?And then a little closer to home , how are you thinking of – it seems that you’re assuming that lending both in the corporate side of things , as well as within Wealth Management , is going to continue at what appears to be roughly similar growth rates as you saw this year . But I guess I’m curious how you’re thinking about what appears to be a greater level of regulatory scrutiny , both in areas like leverage lending but also in commercial Real Estate which – where you’ve grown quite visibly over the last two years to three years , as you’ve pushed on your bank growth program .Just had two areas . One was you talked about funding benefits , I think it’s [ph] point four (01:09:22) at the beginning , tailwind from lower funding costs . I just wondered if you could talk a bit more about how much that was for 2015 and also where we would see it , because I did notice that net interest income in IS was very strong in Q4. I didn’t know if that’s related , so if you could talk about that .And then the last area was really slide 16 and the deposits assumptions . I had thought that there was a big strategy to increase the deposits . I think I had a number in my head of $200B . Has that changed ? Or is it just that you’re not putting that , or you’re not assuming that those are lent within your 2017 kind of roll forward ?Can I just go back to the first thing and what the explanation then for the net interest income in IS is ? For fourth quarter . Institutional Securities .If you look at the size of the balance sheet came down by about $20B vs . the end of Q3, just thinking going forward , how do you think the size of the balance sheet trends , and then , also with respect to SLR exposure ?Yeah . The other question is on growth . We\\'ve been waiting for a long time , but you\\'ve been seeing great growth across a lot of different products . I mean , CRE up 18%, in the Commercial Bank , C&I up 9%. At this stage of the cycle , I appreciate the Consumer has shown a lot of strength , is there any growth where we scratch our heads and said , wow , is that growing too much ? It sounds funny for me to be asking for less growth , but just curious to get your thoughts .Thank you . And then on the loan growth , which is obviously very strong , what are your people on the front lines saying about commercial real estate ? Are there any changes in terms of underwriting metrics that your front line people are seeing since we are starting to see in certain markets like multifamily , which you guys have already identified have some weak spots , are there any other underwriting issues that are cropping up now that you didn\\'t see three months ago or six months ago ?Hi . That was a very serious CEO letter you had in the annual report , but two questions related to that . One would be , you , Jamie , indicate the potential for higher interest rates , and I\\'m just looking for some more color into why you think that\\'s the case , and if you\\'re preparing the bank for a scenario of higher rates or if you\\'re just trying to just set a tone at the top or perhaps be contrarian . I know you gave some technical factors in the CEO letter .If I look at the first quarter net interest income , which was at least better than what I had , good NIM and think about your full-year outlook , if I take it literally , it implies flattish net interest income dollars from here . And I\\'m just wondering if that\\'s too literal of interpretation or if maybe there are some offsets to the loan growth we say over the long-term rates as we think about the rest of the year .Good morning , Marianne , a quick question on NIM here . Can you talk about how sustainable you think the NIM expansion might be and whether or not there\\'s anything one-time in the numbers we should adjust for ?I was wondering on the net interest income side if you could talk a little bit about , Paul , what kind of outlook we should think about for the quarter in net interest income , that was $10.6B this quarter . If rates are relatively stable and we don’t see any hike for a while , how should that trend with all the puts and takes ?Okay , and you do get a day count help , modest , in Q2 from the first too , right ? Doesn’t that help ?On slide 12 you noted your asset sensitivity increased a bunch from the prior quarter , you mentioned driven by the drop in long-end rates . Could you talk through how that actually works and then how much of the $6B is short-end vs . long-end ?On the legacy asset , you lowered your loans from $103,000 to $88,000 on the high touch servicing or default servicing . How much of that was sold or are you guys just working through the book ?Just working it down ? And has the new stuff coming in – is that still a material amount ? Or has that been – is that mainly done , like you’re not really getting a lot of new stuff coming into this bucket ?And then you said like in the quarter , and you disclosed this very clearly , that it’s about $700mm on this . I mean , where can we – can this be cut in half by the end of the year ? When does this really become immaterial , do you think ?If I could just refer back to slide 16 for a moment , there’s been a lot of debate about the dynamics in the auto lending market , about deterioration in underwriting and the risks of large amounts of used cars coming off of lease . Could you give us any granularity about what you are seeing in lending across the FICO spectrum and how you’re anticipating that residual issue to play out ?And when you said that you pulled forward some flow , what do you mean by that ?Brian , right at the outset , you said that there’s really been no meaningful change in the customer base activity . And then following on your comments about stable capital markets , you’re growing the core loan book now double-digits still , 11%. I’m just wondering how much of that is the environment holding up , how much of that is still kind of the spigot opening from reasonable growth , and just your outlook in terms of customer behavior on the lending side .Brian , to that last point , how much opportunity actually , without pointing to compromising , but how much more spigot opening can you still do to your point about the post-crisis , the tightening up internally ? Are you still under-lent if at all ? Or you still have to be somewhat careful about where we are in this stage of the economic cycle , being that we’re seven-plus years into an expansion ?So in some , you think just 10%-plus kind of primary lending is still achievable from – that’s what it sounds like from what you’re saying .I wanted to focus on mortgage banking and the retention of those loans , more on the balance sheet than continuing to push them to the G-SIBs . Is that regulatory driven ? Or are you really kind of looking for that higher retention rate , because you’re looking for some assets that have duration ? So is that one of the better maybe option adjusted yields that you can get at this point ?And a follow-up to that is that if you look at the impact of that on the business segments , you actually are increasing the portfolio by about 30%, which is showing that retention . However , if you look at All Other , it’s more than over swamping that growth .So , you had about $45B reduction . And kind of getting back to Mike’s question about where is the benefits going , just the reduction in All Other , that almost $50B of loans is over $1B worth of NII that is kind of going away , whereas you’re having to do and invest and spend money to generate the 30% growth in the business . So , is the runoff still part of where some of the leakages that we’re hoping to get in all the improvements and growth that you’re showing in the core ? And when does that – what’s left is about $100B , when is that finally done so that you wouldn’t have that leakage anymore ?Yeah , I just wanted to get a sense . You did obviously put – move significant amount – or not significant , but a part of your investments with the Fed into other parts of the portfolio . I just want to get a sense of where you’ve changed . It looks like you’ve accelerated a little bit this quarter . Is that accurate ? And is there more to do that would potentially help support the NIM as we move forward here ?And I think I caught the tailwind of the comments , because I had to jump around on some calls , but are you still in your guidance expecting some rate hikes in 2016?Just on your outlook for Q2 net interest income . I was just curious , how much of an increase you’d consider modest this quarter ?Just a follow-up on the balance sheet mix and composition , Bill , to your point earlier about the TBAs that kind of that closed in Q1 and led to a bigger portfolio . Just with rates having moved down on the long end , I just wanted to update your – get your updated thoughts on using cash from here , what you’re doing with securities portfolio run-off and how you want to try to balance that mix right now ?And then , as far as just your loan outlook , loan growth’s been pretty good . And it looks like it’s still been pretty diverse . You had taken a little bit of a pause prior just given that we’re seeing some competition and we’re kind of long in the cycle . How do you just look at the competitive landscape in terms of pricing , and where you’re seeing growth in the commercial side of the loan portfolio as far as your expectations going forward ?Just a question on the consumer growth . That’s been much lower than what you’ve seen on the commercial side despite what appears to be a bit more demand on the consumer side . So , I guess , I’m curious . Maybe , Rob , can you give us a little more color as to what’s going on specifically within the consumer portfolio , and why it appears you all are growing that portfolio a little bit slower than peers ? And I’m wondering if there’s a decline in the government insured portfolio within other consumer that’s maybe hiding some of the core growth there ?And then if I can just – as a follow-up , Bill , I think you mentioned earlier in your comments about a re-pricing across some of the commercial areas , which I took to mean an upward re-pricing .Can you give us a little more color on that and how those re-pricing efforts are being responded to by clients ?Hi . I\\'ll switch it up . In terms of net interest income , John , how much have you benefited from the December hike in the first quarter ? Have all the variable loans repriced and will it be additional pull through benefit from that December hike into the second quarter ?I just want to delve into a couple of potential earnings levers going forward . I guess the first one would be as we think about the liquidity that you\\'ve built since you chose not to reinvest as much in the securities book . How are you thinking about that pool of funds going forward ? There are not really any signs that rates are going to rise materially as we think about market rates . We\\'re obviously off the bottom , but what\\'s your approach to managing that liquidity from here ?Okay . And then , just a question on rates in balance sheet , so you brought down Fed funds a bit , is that right ?Right . And that was mostly because of your view on rates and where you wanted to reinvest .So , a 25 bp increase in rates today , are you in a more asset-sensitive position now because of that ?Okay . And then on the redeployment into securities , I know you might want to have a higher rate to redeploy into . But is there a point where you say , you know what , I wanted to but it\\'s been 1.7% for five , six , seven , eight months , whatever it is . I\\'m going to start to redeploy some of my cash into longer-duration paper . I mean , can you just give us a sense as to how you think about that ?Okay . If I could ask a totally unrelated question , home equity lines of credit seem to be coming back into favor , both at the banks and among consumers . Can you just speak to that business ? You\\'ve always been important in it . Is it growing now ? And how do you feel about it ?And then , John , just lastly , trying to climb into your head a little bit is as you were looking at the first quarter and you had the gain from selling the crop insurance business and rates were going down and you had so much market disruption , were you thinking in a sense of , well , I have this gain over here , I dont really feel comfortable putting my liquidity to work because of what\\'s going on in the market ? That gives me some kind of breathing room to kind of see where things fall and then start reinvesting in the second quarter , re-creating the income that you gave up in the first quarter .Can you speak to international vs . domestic commercial lending ?Firstly , John , you’d given guidance last quarter for net interest margin at 2.85% to 2.90% for H1. You came in a little bit above that , but was flat linked quarter . Are you still expecting to go to 2.85% to 2.90% for H1? And if so , what would drive that down ?Excellent . Thanks for all that color . And then , thinking about the loan book here , you all saw NII grow faster than loans here this quarter in Wealth Management . And so , it’s right to think about the pickup in LIBOR probably benefiting the PLA portion of that loan book , right ? Just the mechanics of that are the right way – just want to verify that the mechanics of that are the right way to think about it .Yeah , totally fair . Okay . Maybe if we switch over to Investing & Lending . I want to focus on the equity side specifically . In some markets , you had the markets go down and then come back . Asia didn’t snap back . So , I wonder if you could talk about the contribution of that in the quarter . And then , more importantly , for the equity dynamic going forward , like maybe size the portfolio fair value vs . cost basis , see if there are any marks in the quarter that , knock on wood don’t repeat next quarter ? And then just see if you can update us on what’s left to sell down to get compliant ?Okay , thank you . And then on the GE deposits that you got in , just curious how we should think about what kind of economics you can earn on that and any time line for deployment ?So , Harvey , I appreciated the color that you’ve given on some of the factors that were impacting market liquidity , and I know that one of the Fed Governors had recently spoken on the topic and suggested that that reduction in liquidity is a cost worth paying for to help the overall financial system . And given the regulators’ willingness to sacrifice that liquidity to ensure improved safety and soundness , I’m just wondering how that informs your strategy on balance sheet and inventory management ? Have you considered the fact that there might not be any relief on the regulatory side in the context of your longer-term strategy for the business ?Fair . The other thing which I know is a hard question to be able to answer , but it’s kind of important when you start thinking about just what are the core earnings and trying to take out some of the volatility that happens from quarter-to-quarter . The I&L business gives you increased tangible book value , it has been a contributor , so there’s nothing wrong with it , but the volatility does create pressures and then also advantages in certain quarters . What is your just range ? And just kind of you’re not think out the recession , but just kind of think about it in general , what would be the range of outcomes given that you do have some NII in there and you would typically have some flow of deals ? And it could be a broad range . I was just kind of thinking when you budget or plan for some normality , what’s your kind of aspect to what you think about there ?And then the recent history of zero this quarter to $1B would be kind of the range we’ve been seeing . Is that kind of what you would see ?So just looking at your commentary about extending the average maturity of your liabilities and was the $4B of expected liability management this year , could you address one part of your curve which seems to be particularly out of whack with its peers and within its own curve , particularly the 10-year senior bucket ? How are you thinking about this given the amount of debt outstanding at that particular point in the curve and looking to address that ?And then so your deposits continue to grow and your LCR is really robust at 120%. So it seems like you’re pretty well set up for any kind of use using that to I guess , potentially buy back some more equity . I think you mentioned kind of the stronger ask in CCAR this year . But also potentially can you manage down that LCR if let’s say the Fed would raise rates two times this year and then we might see deposit outflows ? Will that also kind of bring down your LCR levels ?Just a few questions on the credit card portfolio because that’s a key product now and you spent a lot of time on it . When you onboard Costco portfolio , how quickly do you contact clients ? Have you already begun that process even before you’ve taken on the portfolio ?And we have heard a lot about the domestic portfolio , but there hasn’t been a lot of discussion about the international credit card business . And I was wondering if you could give some growth parameters , where do you think you can move that operation ?The Asian credit card business , I totally understand there’s been regulatory hurdles . Did that restrict your ability to market ? And why would revenue speed up ?Good morning and thanks for having the call . The [indiscernible] (23:40) proposal just came out , so I am not expecting the company to have a full slide on it , but it would be nice to know , is Morgan Stanley at this point above 100% or do you think you\\'re closer to that 100% requirement , and more importantly how does it impact the secured funding strategy for the company ?Liquidity: do you have excess liquidity and what would drive you to reduce that ?On mix of commercial and consumer , ROE decline attributed to some increase in commercial – interest in migrating to consumer ? Or other portfolio mix considerations ?Dec rate hike impact was less than others in 1Q16 results ?on I&L , you\\'ve outlined before how much you actually need to divest , I think it\\'s by the end of next year , although there might be a one-year additional grant period if needed . But just remind us of how much is private that you need to exit ? And then I think the public piece , which is obviously more liquid , but most of that you see exit as well , if I recall correctly .As we think about it from a balance sheet flexibility , you have – you\\'ve obviously built a lot of liquidity , given the reinvestment rates maybe you weren\\'t where you want them to be , what is the strategy on the liquidity given it seems like the long-term rates are going to move out all that much from here ?And I wanted to ask a clarification question on net interest income . I think it was towards the tail end of Investor Day last week , maybe during the Treasurer\\'s presentation , there was something said along the lines of net interest income growth has been about 4% per annum in recent years . It\\'s not a bad starting point as you think about it going forward , plus or minus . And so , I just wanted to clarify like is that how you think about when you take the mid-single-digit loan growth organic and whatever your NIM expectations are , the 4% net interest income , is it a reasonable kind of jumping off point ?And then , just on the NIM itself , can you talk about some of the puts and takes ? The liquidity obviously can help , as that is deployed , although deposit growth , based on what we can tell from the [ph] HA data (05:31), continues to be quite strong for the industry . So , just talk about the puts and takes on the NIM , maybe X rate and then we\\'ll get into ...And as we layer in the prospect of higher rate , here we are , June 1. Maybe we get an increase this month , maybe next month , as we think about , call it , just one 25 basis point increase on the short end and assuming the long end stays flat , how does that work itself through your net interest margin , I think it\\'s been ...Do you worry the tenure might actually come down as the short end goes up , obviously , that\\'s what happened in December and historically , it is something that often happens , and how do you protect yourself from that ?The [ph] size of (13:43) reinvestment , is there anything with the MSR hedge that we need to worry about as the curve flattens ? I think there\\'s a carry that you\\'re getting right now , because of the steepness of the curve .Is there some magic level where that carry goes away or becomes much more difficult to hedge the MSR ?On the first mortgage side of things , last week , there was an article that you will give 3% down potentially FHA type loans , both out to FHA guarantee . So I guess it\\'s been short like how does that make sense , the low down payment for the kind of emerging home owner historically , I think the view has been that\\'s a riskier product . There\\'s a reason there\\'s insurance behind it , how does that make sense for you to do ?Okay . Great . If we look at interest rates , net interest income , those kind of issues , you\\'ve been able to grow net interest income which is about half of your revenues…...even with a very low interest rate environment . How have you done that ?It\\'s always difficult to strike the right balance between the optionality , the benefit from higher rates and managing for today versus tomorrow and you guys have done a good job of that . Last year , you made a decision to kind of trade in some of the upside from higher rates in order to live in a lower rate environment . What drove that decision and how are you today managing this balance ?Do you think it will take a couple of rate moves to stimulate more deposit to competition ?As we think about the possibility of getting a slow and gradual rate normalization , did we learn anything from the banking industry\\'s reaction to the December rate hike and the benefits that the industry may have seen from the 125 basis point hike ?When you as a company show illustrative scenarios that JPMorgan\\'s earnings are improving , a bulk of that is driven by higher rates . Do you get the benefit with short rates go up but long rates dont ? Is that still very helpful to your case ?It has to do with just the assets being shorter and the lending being done on much shorter on the curve .So are you able to grow net interest income in this environment , even without help from rates ?So we get asked a lot , how is JPMorgan growing loans if 15% of the economy is growing at 2% to 3%? How are you doing that ?Historically , banks haven\\'t really wanted to hold too much in terms of mortgages on the balance sheet through managing the interest rate risk . On the jumbo side with these variable rate loans , do you feel better about it or ...And you mentioned the good commercial loan growth . The line utilizations are still depressed , some banks say , in terms of what customers are utilizing their lines , and it\\'s fairly low .Yeah . Yeah . Do you too find that as well and…Is there any areas of lending that looks stretched to see you ? People point to auto on the consumer side or commercial real estate .Has the fixed income business activity and profitability been hurt by low rates and having a front end of the curve be zero and [indiscernible] (13:02)When the Fed is active on the front and the front end is moving around ?One of the areas that we\\'ve seen some improvement , you started with kind of the net growth to loan portfolio . We ship across several points there , where\\'s the loan growth been accelerating , and what\\'s been driving that ?Anywhere in particular where you kind of opened the spigots more in the last year or so , hired more commercial bankers in C&I , or CRE , or anywhere in particular ?And how much more runoff is there to go ? Is that inconsequential at this point the run-off portfolio ?So , if you look at the consumer loan space , how do you position yourself in credit cards post-crisis ? Everyone is looking to grow cards . How should we think of Bank of America\\'s strategy around credit card ?We\\'ll switch gears , talk a little bit about interest rates and challenge of growing net interest income . Net interest income is about half of your revenues . What\\'s your thoughts on the trajectory of your ability to grow net interest income ? I guess you had about $10.5 billion , $10.6 billion or so in the first quarter . How do you think about the outlook from here ?And no one is expecting that kind of rate move out . If we get 25 basis points , does that incrementally help ?Did you get the benefit from the December hike ? Did you see that in your first quarter ?Right . Okay . And then on the loan growth side , maybe you could speak a little bit to that…...because loan growth has been accelerating . So , if you could talk to where you see pockets of opportunity from here .Is there any – yeah , and so that\\'s another thing . Resi mortgage , obviously , up roughly 20% year-on-year . The bull-bear or the pro-con on that is that you\\'re getting some nicer returns versus holding potentially in securities , but there\\'s a little bit more risk , and also there\\'s some duration issues . Could you talk through how large you\\'re willing for that portfolio to go ?And then as we think about just loan growth in general , every time you put a dollar of loans on , you have to support it with the capital and liquidity requirements and all of those rules and regs there . So , if it\\'s a static equal to the current composition of your loan portfolio , then your ROE is not potentially going up that much . So , should we expect that you\\'re going to skew toward some of the higher , richer margin loans as time goes on , or are you comfortable with the loan mix as it is right now ?And what about just the trajectory for growing the lending book from here ?So , one of the questions I get is that Wells Fargo is a full spectrum lender . You\\'ve got lending across all types of asset classes , as well as industry or borrower profiles . One potential opportunity set for listing , ROA and ROE is to migrate the loan portfolio maybe to a little bit of a richer-mix yield . Would that be something that you would consider doing or no ?Right . Yeah , just a question there . So , because you are one of the only full spectrum lenders across all portfolios -Maybe we can talk a little bit about just what you\\'re seeing in the portfolio today , you know , as we\\'ve gone through the year , we\\'ve gone through a more euphoric period with rate rise very imminent and sharp . And now , we\\'re more in a kind of a little more subdued environment with last data point . Maybe you could give us a sense as to what you\\'re hearing from your customers and what you\\'re seeing with regard to demand for loans , both consumer , commercial in various buckets .Okay . So , we could see a little bit more -Question on home equity , you mentioned that mortgage is going well . How are you thinking about the home equity book ? I mean , we are coming into a period where we have some renegotiations , right , where you\\'re heading your [indiscernible] (08:58).Okay . And the shift out of home equity , is there any benefit to the mortgage numbers from that as you\\'re refi-ing people from a home equity product into mortgage ?And 2016 is one of the higher watermarks of this portfolio , right ?Can we talk a little bit about demand in the energy space ? I mean , obviously , that\\'s an area that had been driving loan growth obviously . Now , you\\'re in a different phase there , but could you talk about whether or not you\\'re seeing that stabilize or is there still some pull back in exposure and then what other parts of commercial are actually available to offset ?And how much of the loan book growth in C&I is really industrial production or inventory or that kind of growth versus lend for deals , lend for M&A , lend for buybacks . Is there a -What about deposit growth ? So , the reason I ask this question is you have a very low loan-to-deposit ratio , right ? And your deposit growth has been very strong , and the question really is , when do you have too much of a good things ?And what are the triggers for that using excess liquidity ?Just it feels like you\\'re under-earning a little bit with so much excess liquidity on the sideline .And then LCR , I think we\\'re going to get the details around your LCR ratio as that has to be disclosed soon . Is that right ?So , I think you\\'ll be getting questions around why is it so high and that you\\'ll have to answer us at some future state .On the rate side , I mean this expectation that you can drive down the expense ratio that comes with a view that rates are rising or that\\'s even if rates dont go up ?All right , I\\'m going to – I\\'ll move to loan growth . One of the questions I routinely get is while BOA\\'s loan growth is in its high as everybody else but on the consumer side , I know you went through couple of reasons why . But maybe you could speak a little bit more of asset class by asset class , in particular with mortgage because we\\'re seeing many of your peers\\' portfolios more . Could you speak to how you\\'re thinking about mortgage ?And you are prime , super prime is average FICO of around 700 or where is that ?Just final question from my end , as we\\'re thinking about the revenue growth list that you\\'re looking for . Is it primarily around the balance growth or are there other things that we\\'re not talking about ?Maybe just talk a little bit about the net interest margin and the outlook there . It was down five basis points . It looked like it was mostly in the funding costs . I just wanted to get a sense of what was driving it . I think long-term debt was up trading liability costs were up . Can you just kind of give us a sense of what’s going on there , and how to think about that going forward ?So my first question is , given how well JPMorgan did on the CCAR relative to last year’s results and it seems like RWA and SLR exposure have stabilized over the past few quarters , how comfortable are you perhaps allocating more balance sheet to the investment bank , given that you seem to be very well positioned to continue to gain market share , especially in Markets ?One , on the outlook page , I see on the printed page it’s the same as what you had last quarter for the company overall , obviously . But I heard the emphasis on NII was on the plus side , $2B year on year plus . Is that the right nuance that you were trying to communicate ?And then on the loan growth side , you’ve been funding this in part from just a mix shift , where your loan-to-deposit ratio has moved up very nicely . It’s still very low at 66%, but up two percentage points Q-on-Q and up from 61% year on year , and I’m just wondering - how far do you think you can take that before you might want to look to fund loan growth with deposit growth more ratably ?Just one more rate question . As you mentioned , you’re super-sensitive on the front end of the curve , and you just alluded to the curve as flatter . I’m curious about that great chart that you rolled out on Investor Day that talks about we make $3B more through 2018 if rates stay flat and $6B more if the curve goes down the implied path . The implied path is now lower . I’m just curious how much those numbers change if the current curve holds .So a quick question on the mortgage originations . The correspondent channel didn’t change all that much quarter on quarter , although I would have thought with seasonality and a pickup in refis , that would have increased in Q2. Can you talk about how you’re thinking about correspondent mortgage originations ? And given that refi volume looks strong at the start of Q3, should we expect a pickup in correspondent in Q3?Marianne , can you give us some color ? Obviously , your consumer loan growth has picked up quite nicely . You pointed to it’s going to be at the higher end of the range for the year . What are your guys saying on consumer behavior ? Has it improved and they feel stronger about their own job prospects , which is enabling them to borrow more ? Are there any metrics that you guys are looking at from that end ?One of the things about what we saw in mortgage rates , I mean , the 10-year dropping down to record levels in mortgage rates probably following right behind it . Can you give us a little outlook ? Are you seeing an uptick in refis ? We’ve seen the refi indexes go up very high . And any outlook on where you think the mortgage market’s going to be in the next quarter or two ?And the other – your follow-up question is , there are some – there is an article out there about JPMorgan securitizing conforming loans . This hasn’t really been done a lot by anybody . I don’t know if you can address that , the economics behind that or what the thought behind that instead of getting Fannie and Freddie wraps and just securitizing them yourself .Wanted to ask you a little bit about the focus everybody has on the flattening of the treasury curve , but yet , earlier , you were able to say that going into next year , you would see a 2016 NII growth of $2B to $2.5B , only really fall to $1.5B to $2B , which means that that flattening of the yield curve is very manageable . Just talk about asset yields as your earning asset yield actually went up one basis point and what you’ve been able to see in the market vs . what’s happening in the treasury curve .In this particular quarter , your funding costs went up . Is that a lag effect from what – the rate hike in kind of December still just now coming through or was there something else maybe more unusual about the funding costs that we saw – that drove the margin down this particular quarter ?And as we think about balance sheet mix management near-term , I’m wondering if , I guess what it would take to maybe extend , even more aggressively , extend duration and sort of protect the margin near-term ? Or you’re not going to manage your asset and liabilities based on , sort of , how the market’s thinking about the curve near-term ?Just when you look at mortgage revenues this quarter , were they where you thought they’d be ? And what do you expect going ahead ? You said the mortgage pipeline’s up quite a bit .We’ve seen loan growth outpacing deposit growth for several quarters at both Wells Fargo and the industry in general . In a post-LCR world where HQLA levels are a factor , how high do you think we can expect loan-to-deposit ratios to rise ? And with loan growth continuing at a healthy clip , can you envision a scenario where competition for deposits begins to heat up among banks , and basically , it causes them to start raising rates possibly even before the Fed as competition for deposits intensifies ? Can you just speak to that ?And then just on the liquidity cash on the balance sheet , when we look at that fed fund sold like roughly $300B , is there any way for us to kind of get a sense of how much that might be redeployable vs . how much is needed to meet the requirements of LCR and other kind of regulatory needs to hold liquidity ?And then a quick follow-up on net interest income . Assuming the rate environment doesn’t change much , can you talk a little bit about the puts and takes for growing net interest income ? Maybe size up the degree of difficulty of growing that going forward ? And then regards to the introduction of your first mortgage , have you seen an incremental increase in your overall mortgage originations from the introduction of that product ? Or would you expect that to accelerate on a go-forward basis ?On the follow-up to Kevin’s questions on your first mortgage , is this very similar to an FHA product but outside of the FHA arena to a Fannie and Freddie product , i .e ., is it low FICO , low down payment type loans ?And this product will be sold – I mean either sold or wrapped by Fannie Mae guarantees ?You mentioned in the press release about the higher amortization on the mortgage bond book , which makes sense given the sharp drop in the rate , but do you have the figures in terms of how much it was this quarter vs . last ? And remind us how your strategy or approach there is . Is there like a mark-to-marketing or is there a smoothing effect ? One of your peers has what feels like a mark-to-market impact , so they take their hit upfront . Some of your peers smooth out a little bit more . Remind us how your approach is .A question on the investment portfolio . John , you’d mentioned that you’d added a lot of securities this quarter before the rate change , and looks like you did it mostly in the agency MBS and the held to maturity . And I’m just wondering , given it looks like that average yield was [ph] one nine year (01:04:33) below given that’s where the average are , how are you thinking about continuing to build the securities book vs . potentially keeping more of your originated production where you can get a free handle still vs . maybe a [ph] one-and-a-half (01:04:45) in the securities book ? So what’s your trade-off on interest rate risk vs . credit risk I guess ? And does your philosophy change given where we are in the environment at all ?The C&I growth seemed a bit softer this quarter , particularly relative the pace you saw through much of last year . Is there anything to that besides maybe some impact from energy ? And just how in general do you feel business owner confidence is these days , particularly given some of the uncertainties like Brexit and the upcoming election ?When you look at the balance sheet , when you look at the kind of on the liability side of the balance sheet , if you look at it year-on-year , you’ve seen deposits up $60B where most of the funding is coming from short-term borrowings and long-term debt . So is there something changing in the depositor base ? Or are depositors becoming more rate sensitive , and that’s why you’re not seeing the deposit growth that you once were especially this quarter where it’s only been $4B on end of period for total deposits ? Yeah , just wondering if there’s a change in the depositors there ?Got it . And a follow-up question on the margin . Appreciate the color that you gave in terms of the puts and takes of Costco for the second half ofthe year . If the slope of the curve persists or there is continued pressure on the long end , how should we think about how the margin will progressGreat . One last little one from me , in terms of your NIM comments . And then so we know that Costco\\'s gone a full quarter in the third . Pretty goodline of sight in terms of being able to grow NII from here ?Okay . I was speaking of within Citicorp rather than broadly . Would Citicorp still be broadly low ? Like -- I think it was up about 1% in the period .Okay . And then just moving on to page 24 of the supplement , I realize we\\'re looking add end-of-period balances so there may be somethingskewing this a little bit . But the corporate loans in EMEA grew in the second quarter at a much faster rate than you\\'ve seen them grow year overI\\'m curious if that\\'s a one-quarter blip possibly driven by Brexit . Or are you really driving market share gains on the lending side , partly because ofHi . It\\'s Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley . How are you doing ?Hey . A couple of questions . So part of the investment  thesis in PNC is the excess liquidity that you have that can get put to work over  time . And what I heard you say , Bill , is that , look , you\\'re not going to do anything . It doesn\\'t make sense from a balance sheet perspective .  So does that mean you\\'re going to continue to hoard liquidity for the moment ? How do you think about using it ? And what are the trigger points for unlocking some of that potential earnings ?So could I just – a follow up on that is on loan spreads  and what are you seeing there and does that incent you to do more at this stage or not ?All right . So we should look more further consumer to drive  the bus there on loan growth ?Yes . Can you talk a little bit about your different  geographic  experiences  with loan growth ? I know you\\'ve  been down in the South now for about two years or three years and how that\\'s going relative to the Northern  franchise ?Thank  you . And just one separate question , kind of a ticky-tack one . I noticed the CRE yield came under , it looks like a little more pressure than is typical . I wonder if you could just sort of expand upon that from 3.51% down to – in the 1Q , down to 3.16% in the 2Q . Just any comments [indiscernible] (30:36)?Thank  you . Good morning .  If we go down the path where , say , the Fed concludes that the risk of raising rates at any point over  the next , say , 12 months and possibly pushing the economy into recession outweighs  the potential benefits , can you speak to what happens to PNC\\'s NII and earnings  in that environment ?  And more broadly , everyone\\'s  a little different .  But how should we think about PNC\\'s ability to grow earnings  in the absence of higher rates ?Thank  you . That\\'s really helpful .  If you guys will kindly allow me , maybe I could just ask one more follow-up  to the initial question . So there are some folks , some banks that will talk about their ability to kind of still be able to grow NII through faster loan growth kind of offsetting NIM compression . And of course , with you guys , we\\'re  dealing  with the purchase accounting accretion issues .But if you were to set that aside and you kind of move forward  in time to the point where the purchase accounting accretion headwinds  are completely gone , do you think that – is there like a structural difference  between PNC\\'s model versus  other banks that are saying they can still grow NII even  in an environment  where rates dont grow or dont rise , or would you guys be able to ...Maybe I could follow up a little bit on the NII discussion . Maybe if you could help us think through – you talked about near-term kind of flattish , but as we think a little bit longer term , if the forward curve is realized , and/or maybe give some color . You\\'ve had good deposit growth , core loan growth of 9%, but net loan growth\\'s only been about 2.5%, do we start to see that inflect more ? And does that start to help the out years as well ? So , just any color on NII beyond the next quarter or two would be helpful .So , I know – I guess you dont want to put too many numbers around it , but should we think that maybe starting in 4Q or 1Q , we might start to see some incremental NII growth , and maybe that accelerates , as you point out , the loan growth overwhelms the rate picture ?I apologize for going back to the net interest income issue , but obviously , the reason why central banks keep interest rates down is because they expect it to increase lending . And I\\'m wondering if you\\'ve done any elasticity studies , which show what happens to loans when interest rates go down or up . And as part of that , there are multiple examples of what happens to earnings if interest rates go up 100 basis points or down . And I\\'m wondering if you\\'ve done anything to show if interest rates remain flat and loans go up 2%, 5%, 6%, 8%, what the impact on earnings would be .What I\\'m asking to get a lot more specific in the sense that you do this with interest rate changes , right ? In other words , there\\'s these bubble charts , which show what will happen to net interest income if interest rates go up 100 basis points . There\\'s nothing which says what happens to earnings if you see a 5% increase in loans . In other words , what is more important ? I mean , in the old days , people would show these charts if you hold interest rate flat and volume goes up . What happens to earnings if you get a 5% increase in lending as a result of interest rates staying so low ?And then just separately on the bank initiative , you did mention about rolling out the digital consumer lending platform in the fall . But just more broadly speaking , maybe give us an update on where you are on the lending thought process overall ? And then on the deposit side as well , I think you did the brand conversion of the deposit acquisition this past quarter .And sorry , what is that one product ? Is it in unsecured loan or what’s the ...Would they , I mean , a target customer of kind of short duration , small loan size , bigger loan size , what’s kind of the ...Quick one on NII . I think when you were walking through I&L you said that NII was around $250mm or so . So , if we’re run rating that at about $1B , when we look at your I&L balance sheet in the 10-Q , and just using the last quarter’s numbers because I doubt they\\'re that different . If we sum up the debt and loans , you get to about $70B or so , just over , which is a little over a 1% net yield . Now , is it that funding costs for that portfolio are really high , or is it that the asset yields are low ? What causes that yield to seem a bit low to folks ?So , it’s more on the asset side rather than on the funding side ?Just a couple of quick follow ups . First of all , in terms of the additional global core liquidity you had on the balance sheet at both the end of the quarter and for the average of the quarter , that was up a bit from last quarter . Is that primarily due to the GE deposits , or is there something else going on there ?And then just in terms of the backlog decline both sequentially and y-over-y , is there any specific geography , Asia , Europe , North America , that is meaningfully stronger or weaker within that trend ?Good morning .  Can you give  an update on the bank effort  in Wealth Management ?  You had continued good loan growth this quarter .  Deposits were down a little bit versus  last quarter but still up nicely year over year . And just how are you feeling about the outlook for both loan and deposit growth going forward ?On slide 8, talking about deposit trends . We’ve seen inflows . Given the changes in money market regulation , are you anticipating more of those funds coming over to you in the form of deposits ? Or – and have you seen that already ? I guess is my question .On the insurance side , I know you guys have been issuing opportunistically and above and beyond maturities , and at the same time there’s a slide that points out the ICS balance sheet has come down a fair amount over the last couple of years . So , in terms of how you think about use of proceeds , to the extent that you – if you were to continue opportunistically issuing , how do you think about – what does the business do with those proceeds ?I was just looking at your credit card new accounts opened at 19% and auto finance up 20%, why aren\\'t we scared that you\\'re growing right at the peak of the cycle ?In regards to the rise in three months\\' LIBOR or the TED spread , do you think it\\'s more of an opportunity for Bank of America or more of a threat ? Thank you . You made a comment earlier about the growth in your loan portfolio being significantly slower at the moment . Could you comment a little bit on that , clarify if it\\'s due to the economy , the election , what kind of uncertainty you said the corporates were just unwilling to use their revolvers and less M&A . So , what do you think is going on in the overall economy ?I guess , John , I guess there are some people coming into the conference a little bit concerned on loan growth given some of the softness in ag data particularly C&I . We\\'ve just heard mixed commentary from the companies . I guess what are you seeing maybe across your footprint ?I guess , a lot of new interesting information there . I guess , first off , on the consumer lending front , you talkedabout expanding and kind of accelerating growth in several areas , like credit card or auto and the like . Can youjust talk to the competitive landscape in those businesses , and is this kind of potentially – maybe not – like why isthis the right time to try to accelerate growth in those areas ?So , the $250 million home lending opportunity , should we think of that as incremental or separate from continuousimprovement or is that just part of the annual continuous improvement ? Thank you .On the net interest margin and net interest income , when we try to assess the impact of what a potential rate hike would do , one rate hike – it’s hard to discern what happened after the December hike last time , because in Q1 you had a few moving parts . What’s your best guess of kind of what kind of help you would get to your NIM from one rate hike ? And then what’s the ongoing impact to NIM on the other side from TLAC issuance , in terms of drag ?I was wondering if we could just talk about the environment a little bit . Loan growth was okay , but certainly we’ve seen this kind of air pocket on the commercial side a little bit from the industry perspective . And I’m wondering if you could just talk about what you guys are seeing in terms of commercial demand , especially . And if you’re seeing any just noted changes in terms of customer activity , and whether you think that’s either fleeting or whether you guys are taking a different view of extension of credit at all ?I noticed that the securities book was $390B at the end of the quarter . Looks like you’re moving some of that liquidity maybe also in replacement of some of that loan growth .Can you just talk about the reinvestment philosophy , what kind of stuff you’re investing in , and are you able to find a good ROA , ROE on moving the book into securities at this time given where rates are ?And then maybe on some of these new account production metrics , it’s very helpful , I appreciate the disclosure . I’m assuming the average life of checking accounts and credit cards is pretty long . So is there like a rule of thumb translation you can give us ? If the run rate of new accounts is down 25% for six months , let’s say , is that a one percentage point headwind to balance growth , two percentage points ? How should we think about that in terms of thinking about balance growth all else equal over the next two years ?I never thought I’d ask you about this page of your press release again , but I’m looking at page 31 at the accretable yield , which usually wiggles and wobbles by $100mm or $200mm a quarter , and all of a sudden , the expected cash flows are down by almost $5B . So can you say what happened there ? And does that – is that a headwind to net interest income going forward ?So , that would be elevated accretion into net interest income then the next couple of quarters , whatever , as you experience that ?And then a headwind in future quarters after that . Okay .I mean obviously there’re going to be some near-term issues here , not only retaining customers but in attracting new ones . And I am wondering if there is any thought being given to deposit pricing or fees , et cetera , as one of the levers to attract new clients .Just one follow-up . If I could get just a high-level comment on , has anything material changed in terms of rate or curve sensitivity as you remix the portfolio and as you’re getting all this great loan growth ? I’m just curious on the current positioning .And maybe just a follow-up on deposits . You guys have very good trends in retail , but on the institutional side , there was quite a bit of flow , it looks like as well . Any particular drivers there ? Was it money market reform helping the flows in institutional or something else ?Can you give any color on your outlook for margin throughout 2017? To me , Fed commentary suggests that rates could remain low and potentially hover around these levels over the next 12 months . So how can we think about your NIM in that type of scenario ? And then what would a December rate hike do for your outlook ?And then switching gears , your CRE and C&I lending was pretty strong this quarter , and regulators have obviously grown a little bit more cautious on those segments . So if you could , just give any preliminary outlook on lending to those segments going forward .Fair enough , two small ones to follow up . Specifically on the loan hedges in ICG , are they always going to be offsetting the positives ? In other words , is that how the hedges will work , and we’ll just have to deal with a negative line when things are going well ? And then on securitized products that were up 40%, what specific products are there ? And does it feel sustainable for now , in your opinion ?Maybe on the Card business , you guys I think had 5% q-over-q growth in period-end balances , so obviously still very good momentum . Can you help us think about was that a big flurry up front and it’s starting to slow or are you seeing that momentum continue ? How do we think about the next quarter or two in terms of the pace of new sign-ups ?So would you say that in terms of the long-term accretion , obviously the next few quarters , you won’t see it , but long-term , has it increased your expectation around accretion ?Okay , great . And then just on the ICG side , as far as just the business growth , loans have been certainly growing . A couple peers are growing faster , but you have that non-U .S . business . So can you just talk about demand for credit and where you sit in terms of willingness to continue to push that directionally as well as you continue to grow Treasury and Trade and the other parts of ICG ?Just to follow up , I just wanted to make sure I understood your response to John’s question correctly when he was asking about Card . Just taking a step back , as we think about operating leverage in the North American Consumer Bank overall , should we interpret your answer as operating leverage is likely going to be more achievable in 2018 given the investment cycle – positive operating leverage ?Okay . And then just finally for me , in terms of the net interest margin , you expect that to be stable in Q4. Last quarter , you had anticipated that Costco might have a modest benefit to the margin . Where’s the change in the outlook there ? Is it just cash balances or is it something else ?I have a quick question on the Costco you mentioned , the new account openings . But could you give us some color on the progression of those new account openings ? Like , are you at a run rate right now where you can say this is about on average what we’re opening per week or per month ?Okay . And then I just had one – a different question on the – you mentioned that there was an improvement in the yield in Asia . Can you maybe give us some background on to what’s allowing you to have or see that improved yield ? Is it a change in geographies ? Is it just new loans coming on at higher yields ?Great . And then on to deposits . You guys saw some very good deposit growth in the ICG business in the quarter on a sequential basis . Did the change in the money market mutual funds had any impact on that growth ?I was just looking for a clarification . You had mentioned there wouldn’t be positive operating leverage until 2018, but I think you were referring to a specific area as opposed to the firm .A couple of questions . One’s on excess liquidity . Just wanted to get your sense of how much dry powder you think you have .And then , lastly , if I may ask one more on the loan side . I think you alluded to a little bit on the consumer side , but I just want to see if the consumer loans inflected this quarter after a while of abatement given some runoff . So , just wanted to see what you’re seeing there and do you think that’s sustainable .Could you offer a little bit more perspective on some of the consumer loan growth trends ? I know there’s been a fair amount of runoff in the HELOC and the student lending books . But at a recent conference , you laid out some pretty ambitious growth targets for card and some other consumer areas .So , I guess the question is , can you maybe elaborate a little bit on what you’re seeing in terms of consumer borrowing and maybe how quickly you could start to see the benefits of some of the different initiatives that you laid out ?And maybe if I could follow up with a question on operating leverage . It looks like you’re on pace to achieve some this year despite very minimal benefit from interest rates . It may be premature to start speculating about 2017 given that you’re going to the budgeting process now , but assuming we do get that additional rate hike in December , would it be realistic to expect a continuation of that more positive trend next year ?We saw your commercial real estate balances move up again in Q3. And as it relates to warnings that we’ve heard from regulators recently on CRE , have you seen any impacts to the markets in which you operate recently ?And then the second question just quickly on net interest income . Can you help us try to translate your 100 basis point rate sensitivity into something closer to what one Fed hike might do for your net interest income and what would be the trajectory of NII and NIM if we did get a Fed hike this quarter ? What would you expect more in the near term , next quarter or two , on NII and NIM ?Just one on loan growth . Could you give us a sense as to how you think you’re trajecting there ? We talked a little bit about market share and trading . Could we talk a little bit about how you think you’re doing in the lending side of the equation and if there’s any legs there ?Can you talk about the strategy within the securities book ? You did mention that you added some later in the quarter and , obviously , deposit growth has been exceeding loan growth to justify that . But maybe give some color in terms of what you’re buying , the duration , and how – make sure it doesn’t get too big relative to the size of the balance sheet ?And then a little bit related but on the deposit side , obviously , very strong growth y-over-y . You mentioned the $60B and really little to no repricing despite the one bump in Fed rates that should impact the y-over-y comps . So I guess the question is , if we do get a rate increase , do you think you’ve got more flexibility to limit deposit repricing , given it’s basically worked so far and the loan growth is obviously not enough to absorb the deposit growth you have ?I guess a similar question on commercial lending . You referenced some of the strategies you’ve had in place driving responsible growth and how you felt good about the business going forward . But we saw this pause across the industry in Q3 in commercial growth , the Fed numbers , your numbers , other banks reporting so far . Have you seen signs of customer demand coming back I guess late in Q3 and early in Q4? Do you have visibility and confidence that the commercial loan growth cycle more broadly is still in gear ?Paul , your deposits at the Fed declined pretty sharply , almost 20% linked quarter , even though you had deposit growth , given that long-term rates are still pretty low , can you talk a little about what drove that thinking ?Is that saying that you don’t expect rates to go up that much , given that you moved credit chunk at a time when long-term rates were pretty low ?I wanted to ask you about two strategic balance sheet decisions . One is that there seems to be a lot more retention mortgages . So when we have these kind of surges , we’re not picking up as much mortgage fees , but growing mortgage loans maybe a little bit faster . That is a shift . And do you think that will hold mortgage fees down and trade off for further net interest income down the road ?You talked about the big question on asset sensitivity , which is duration expectation on your deposits . As you’ve gone through this cycle , and initially we all assumed that there was going to be a lot more volume runoff , then the volume just keep going higher . Have you adjusted that duration ? And is that part of why you’re also comfortable putting on more mortgages that have longer duration feel to it ?Well , I’ll take it if we get a little bit higher operating environment . One last one on I&L . It’s interesting that the pickup multiples were near their highs and you would expect a lot of exits . This one happened to be a better quarter . You talked about some company specific sales and the up markets , but I guess the question is are you finding opportunities to also put money to work , especially on the equity side . I saw the UFC deal and I’m a huge Conor McGregor fan , but that was close to the six times cap . So curious about how you see the investing environment for I&L .How big is the I&L balance sheet now ? You said it’s 80% fixed income , but it’s over $100B now ?So a question on your consumer lending efforts . Given the firm will be facing a very different demographic than you have historically faced , can we just talk about how you think about reputational risk and how you mitigate it ?I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the targeted customer base for the new lending platform in terms of FICO scores , income or however you’re defining it ?And I guess how do you define prime ? I mean , it’s a pretty big segment overall .Okay . And then just over time , will you provide more disclosures on this ? Because as I step back and look at some of the names I cover , this seems like it could be one of the kind of meaningful new initiatives that’s out there in terms of changing the profile of the company a little bit . And I think more disclosures over time would be helpful to be able to track the performance .I wanted to just follow up on the I&L questions . Specifically , maybe you just give us some color , maybe some examples of how you have been continuing to see the equity balances to offset the gains harvesting that you’ve been doing over the past couple of years , because you’ve harvested quite a bit and yet you’ve been able to maintain that asset line item in the $21B , $21.5B range . And sort of in the context of that , maybe you can comment on some of the recent proposals or requests that the Fed has made for congressional action to tighten up Volcker ?But just from a planning perspective , I mean is there any reason to think that that – or that this environment , that those policy dynamics are changing over , let’s say , a medium-term horizon ?Got it . That’s great . Very helpful . Maybe just a quick follow-up . Just any update on the momentum in deposit gathering within the online bank , just how that has been ? I don’t know if you could give any numbers there , but how that’s been maybe relative to expectations now that we’re a little ways away from the launch .Got it . Great , that’s very helpful . And then , you guys have $27B of debt maturing over the next 12 months . How should we think about the delta between those rates relative to the current market rates , to try and get a sense of orders of magnitude of impact , assuming you replace that ?My question was about net interest income in Wealth Management . Could you talk more about margins ? They do seem to be pretty strong in Q3, but if you adjust for the prepayment , which I don’t think we really knew how much that impacted Q2, but you can help us on the trends in margins in Wealth Management . Thank you .And can I just check on the net interest income margin specifically , that there’s no funny , that that’s a good base from which to forecast going forward ? It’s just so much higher as a percentage of assets than it’s been for a while .Okay , that’s fair . And then maybe on the capital side , I think CET1 clearly very strong , but the SLR , I guess , is where if we look at your progress to-date , it’s been not as rapid as on the RWA side in Fixed Income . What’s driving the slower progress on the SLR and do you still feel confident you can get to the targets ?Great . Thank you . That’s very helpful . And my next question is around TruPS that have been issued by Citigroup Capital XIII . So basically looking at slide 25 here . So I believe these TruPS are permanently grandfathered , and given the high cost of this , and these are already callable structures , a call with securities relative to others , so do you plan on ever calling this security and maybe potentially replacing with prefs ?Just a question in terms of the non-call floating rate structures . Does that in a sense change any way the way you manage debt risk on your balance sheet ? And then kind of related to that question is also , why use the floating rate structure as opposed to a fixed rate structure in the past ? Is there something going on there that\\'s appealing to issue floating rate securities ?Just really why the issuance of floating rate securities as opposed to fixed rate ? Is there a change in issuance by investors\\' demand ? Or you can kind of push through some more to the market ?The follow-up question , just in terms of the sub debt issuance plans for the next 12 months , can you mention those and also the amortization of your sub debt profile ?I also have a question on the callables and it’s clear why callables are attractive , not just for TLAC , but for other reasons as well . And it’s clear why callables , within callables , that floating rate structures have certain advantages to fixed rate structures . But my question is on the size of the dollar FRN market , which is currently a small fraction of the size of the fixed rate corporate market . Do think that the dollar FRN market is large enough or that it can grow large enough over time to readily absorb the amount of floating rate debt that you and your peers may like to issue over time ?Yes , my follow up is actually on the response that you gave to Mark when he asked about sub debt issuance over the next 12 months . And you had said that it\\'s really too early to tell , but , broadly speaking , next year issuance should be similar to this year and that sub debt issuance would be to replace decay . When you made the comment that , broadly , next year issuance should be similar to this year , was that specific to sub debt or were you talking about debt more broadly , senior and sub together ?Can you share with us the usage of the cards ? Have you seen an increased usage of your existing customers ? Obviously , credit card outstandings for the industry are finally growing . Is your growth more new acquisitions , or how much is new acquisitions versus just your customers are revolving more and your balances are growing that way ?Aside from cards that are adjustable rate price cards , and so as rates rise there , their interest rates will go up , can you share with us what\\'s your ability to raise those rates as we go forward ? What are you looking in the competitive dynamics ? How important is the actual rate that you\\'re charging your customer weigh on their decision versus the benefits of having Sapphire or some other card ?In terms of [ph] acceptances (24:36), and I\\'m not going to ask you to give us the numbers , but have you see an uptrend ? In terms of your sophistication that you just described in reaching out to your customers , are you seeing an improvement in the number of ...So switching topics , the results of the election have clearly put out of vogue any asset class or sector that has benefited from low interest rates . Even before the election results , there was a lot of talk about commercial real estate , especially multi-family .So maybe before I ask you your viewpoint as the number one multi-family lender in the United States , I wanted to see how our audience is feeling about this asset class . So , Eddie , if we could , pull up the next question for JPMorgan please .How do you view fundamentals for multi-family lending in 2017: one , softening fundamentals should lead to slower financing activity next year; two , softening fundamentals should lead to worsening credit metrics; three , softening fundamentals should lead to slower financing activity and worsening credit metrics; four , some concern but only in certain regions and at certain rental price points; or five , no concern ?So interestingly , 48% of you say that there\\'s some concern , but only in pockets in certain regions and at certain rental price points . The next most popular answer is , at 35%, softening fundamentals should lead to slower financing activity and worsening credit metrics .And about how much of your properties have stabilized rent cash flow ?Hi . Can you describe what you mean by $4 trillion of commercial finance opportunities ? How does that ..So it incorporates new and refinancing loans ? It\\'s new purchasing and refinancing .Okay . So as you mentioned , rate expectations have changed a lot . How are you changing your thought process around the duration of the securities portfolio , the composition of the securities portfolio ? And if we do get another rate hike in December , how do you think it will differ in terms of deposit betas relative to what we saw a year ago ?Can you maybe expand the answer a little bit to talk about how you think corporate tax reform and infrastructure spending will impact corporate loan demand over the next few years , if those two things get executed ?So at this stage , you\\'re not building then any faster economic growth translating into faster loan growth ?So they\\'ve also talked about the Volcker Rule being needed to be revisited . Do you think changing the Volcker Rule would enhance market liquidity , and do you think it would have a material impact on the funding cost for corporate if they were to change it ?I mean , you\\'re obviously one of the world\\'s largest market makers . So do you think a repeal of the Volcker Rule or a material change would impact JPMorgan now ?Okay . So one of the very tangible things that\\'s changed in this election is interest rates . And the 10 year is up , I think 60 basis points since November 7. How is that impacting your thought process around how you invest your excess liquidity ? How is it impacting your thought process around your securities portfolio ?Okay . So , I think the last rate hike that we saw , the 25 basis points , I think the deposit betas across the system were somewhere between 4% to 6%, much lower than people had thought , much lower than many banks had modeled . For the next few rate hikes , do you see that changing materially ?Okay . So one of the areas that you\\'ve done very well on is loan growth . Your loans are , I think , up 18% since 2013. The industry is up about 15%. How do you get investors comfortable with the fact that you\\'re not trading off growth for credit quality , for example ?Okay . So , one of the very tangible things that changed since the election is interest rates and interest rate expectations . I think you were previously in the camp of lower for longer . How has the election process changed your thought process around the speed of Fed tightening ? And how are you thinking about changing the way that you manage your liquidity in the light of what\\'s happened to ratioThe deposit rate is obviously one of the critical assumptions figuring out your rate sensitivity . I think we calculated for the industry that the deposit rate around the rate hike in December was around 4% to 6%. For the next rate hike , do you think it\\'s going to be materially different ?And similarly , on the consumer side , you\\'d seen this relevering of consumer balance sheets over the course of 2016 actually with an accelerating pace . As you look at 2017, how do you think again that shifts ?I mean , one of the most tangible things that has changed is interest rates and interest rate expectations , so the 10 years moved , I think , what is it ? 70 basis points almost now I think for the election and obviously Fed funds futures are also now pricing in a much faster rate of tightening . How do you incorporate that into you budget process , or do you ignore it taking into account that we\\'re just back to where we were a year ago ?So , just , again , short term , puts and takes of the rate hike , hopefully , that we\\'re going to get this month , how do you think they differ relative to what we saw a year ago ? I mean , obviously , deposit data\\'s ended up being a lot lower . The outflows out of the banking industry ended up being a lot lower . Do you think we\\'re going to get a replay or you think it could be – start to be different this time around ?So , I know you\\'re not going to answer this , but I\\'m going to ask it anyway . If it was up to you , what would be the appropriate level of liquidity that you would…Do you think the Volcker Rule has materially impacted market liquidity from your perspective ?But how much of an opportunity is that for Citigroup ? Because you\\'re clearly seeing this retrenching in Europe , the European banking systems . You didn\\'t mention balance sheet lending . Is that an opportunity in Europe ?Okay . So , let\\'s talk a little bit about Costco because that\\'s obviously been a huge success , as you said a million sign ups . Some of the offsets to that success just from a near-term profitability standpoint of being the impact on having to build the reserve and having to obviously build rewards . We heard exactly the same thing from JPMorgan yesterday . How long do you think it will take for profitability in that book to normalize it ? And what do you now think is a realistic range given the fact that it has been more successful than I think you thought at the time of launch ?And that\\'s similar on the reward component as well .Marianne , I was just wondering . I know you’ll give us more at Investor Day . But just in terms of that first quarter starting point for NII and just how it translates between growth in the balance sheet , and then you mentioned the benefit from the rollover in rates , can you help us just try to think about how you parse those views out and think about volume vs . rate ?Understood , great . And if I could ask a follow-up , just on the volume side , you had another great year of double-digit loan growth . And obviously , we’re at this intersection between what was and then what will be . Any change to that expectation that you could just grow the loan book , core loan book that is , as strongly as you have in the past three years ?I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the forward look NII up a bit , but also expenses up a bit , and I just wanted to understand . Is that because you’ve got the opportunity to reinvest in things that you haven’t been able to ? And if you could , just speak to what kind of timeframe the reinvestment will yield returns because the question I’ve gotten from people is why aren’t you dropping the NII benefit to the bottom line here .And then the related follow-up has to do with how you’re thinking about the excess cash you’ve got and the balance sheet duration , and if there’s anything in this new interest rate environment that you would be seeking to do to optimize your position . If I can circle back to the discussion on net interest income and the rate leverage , I think the outlook for net interest income to grow over $3B vs . the $1.5B before the rate increase , that’s obviously a nice lift for just a 25 basis point bump on the short end . So I guess , one , does that include the benefit of longer-term rates since they’ve moved up as well since 9/30, which I assume it does , but just to confirm that ? And then secondly , what’s the levers to rising rates from here as we think about movements on both the short and long end ?And that’s actually going to my follow-up question . On the size of the balance sheet , you did talk about loan growth of about 10% this year . If we look full-year 2016 vs . 2015, the balance sheet or the earning assets only rose 1%. So maybe to tie that into as you think about duration the fact that you’re sitting on a lot of liquidity and cash , and how we should think about both overall growth on the balance sheet and then potentially some more remixing .Certainly . And , Marianne , coming back to the investment portfolio , obviously you talked a little bit about the duration . Do you have the actual duration of it in years this quarter vs . Q3?Do you foresee that premium for liquidity lessening as we go into the re-risking of a better economy and some things that have improved the outlook ?Something you could just sort of address the – of the pace at which you would anticipate deploying liquidity favor the course of the year , can be – I guess I can get a directional sense for what you’ve been doing in the earning asset base , but just curious kind of philosophically how are you thinking about legging into higher interest rates , as we look throughout 2017?And then maybe skipping over to the sort of the volume side of the NII equation . I think Q1 guidance is still for more modest growth , but then you got the stronger growth outlook for the full year on overall loan growth . Just curious as to how you see things building as it relates to overall loan growth in some of the actual favorable impact of some of these newer initiatives on both the consumer and commercial side ?And just one quick one . Can you quantify just how much forward purchases of the securities you did that will settle in Q1?Maybe a question – a couple of related questions for you , Rob . First of all – and I apologize if I missed any comments , you may have said about this early on . But any change to your thinking about managing the AOCI risk as rates rise , now that it at least appears at this point that we could get a little bit greater of a rate increase than we’ve seen in the past few years .And then just on a related question in terms of any change in your thinking about deposit beta . I noticed in Q4, there was a little in – there was a 1 basis point increase in your overall deposit cost , which was actually – last fourth quarter when we had the 25-basis-point hike , there was a 1 basis point decline . So just curious if you – any change in your thinking about deposit beta ?At this point in the credit cycle , PNC’s loan growth would lag the industry and you’ve talked about that for a while now . But if we think about accelerating economic growth , are you willing to take more credit risk to show loan growth ? So is this a different playbook , given the backdrop that’s emerged since the elections ?The seasonal increase in commercial deposits in Q4, has that left the balance sheet by the end of the year , or do you expect seasonality to decline in Q1?I just wanted to follow-up on the question that was just asked about loan growth and you’re saying that C&I loan growth is going to accelerate , given the backdrop that we’re seeing right now . But at the same time , we have corporate leverage which is very high compared to what we saw post crisis and we have interest rates moving higher . How do you think about the balance between corporate leverage being high and rates moving higher , while also seeing growth in companies’ spending ?I had a follow-up question again , I guess , on the commercial loan side . You talked about how strong December was . I wanted to , I guess , follow-up and think about , if we’re looking at the linked quarter , it does look like loan growth was down a little bit from the linked quarter , and actually it was a little softer in the retail , wholesale , and manufacturing side of things . Overall , on a y-over-y basis , it’s only up 2.8%. So I guess are you seeing more extensions of lines of credit , maybe the utilization rates have gone down ? And is there any ...Thinking about your commercial loan growth , you’re continuing to have the sort of runoff in the non-strategic and some of those consumer books , which weigh down the overall consumer . Do you think the 5% – I guess , would it be a 5% plus growth you’ll get from commercial and maybe the consumer would be a positive this quarter or maybe just less of a negative , that gets you to that overall mid-single ?Hi . Good morning . Thanks for taking my questions . I was wondering if we could return to the NII sensitivity ? It would be nice to get some measure of how much our NII would improve for , say , a 100 basis point upward shift in the curve . I think you did something along those lines in the 1Q fixed income presentation last year , so perhaps you can give an update on that ? And then just together with that , perhaps give a sense of how sensitive you are to the short end increase versus long end . Are you predominantly sensitive to short end increasing and then hoping that that short end increases in tandem with what the curve is indicating ?So it sounds like in 2017 you think there might be more opportunity for balance sheet growth ?There\\'s been a lot of focus on the asset sensitivity within the Wealth Management unit specifically but I was wondering if you could comment on how the overall balance sheet is positioned for rising rates including the institutional securities unit and investment management , just thinking about the aggregate balance sheet .And then just finally , if I can , you booked your first loan in Marcus when we spoke last October . Just wondering what the growth in that portfolio has been since then ?I wanted to ask about the rate sensitivity profile , John . I was wondering if there’s been any change in the core rate sensitivity . And could you remind us what kind of benefit you get from the Fed hike that we got in December ?I know you put some swaps on in maybe 2015 it was , what’s muted , what would’ve been your maybe natural asset sensitivity . Just wondering , as maybe you’re thinking about the rate environment evolves , are you able to get out of that and adapt that ? Or is that locked in for a few years ? How’s that ...Your sensitivity also will come from your liquidity deployment . It looks like you put some to work this quarter with the Fed funds sold down $30B . I know you get asked this all the time , but is there a way for us to think about how much of that $270B or so of liquidity is kind of deployable , flexible dry powder vs . kind of needed to meet the various liquidity and other requirements ?I wanted to follow up on a comment earlier . I think you said – I just want to make sure I didn’t hear it incorrectly , but have you promised to keep the absolute size of your balance sheet at the 9/30 level ? Is that the entire balance sheet , or is that just a segment ? Did I miss something there ?Then separately , I know you were alluding to this a little bit earlier with the asset sensitivity questions , but I just wanted to see if I can get some thoughts on your NIM trajectory here in coming quarters . Just given the TLAC pace now is going to be a little bit quicker , I mean that’s a negative drag , but also you’ve got the impact of the rate hike . So how would you be thinking about the trajectory of the margin here through 2017?Couple of questions . One , your guidance for the efficiency ratio remaining high , towards the high end of the range near term , what assumptions do you have baked in for rate hikes ? And when you’re defining rate , I’m presuming near term – I’m presuming you’re thinking 2017?And then when you look at the hedge ineffectiveness related to your long-term debt , I would assume that the credit spread compares , in other words , the real basis risk change was your credit spread gapped out with the reputational issues that you’re working through right now in the marketplace , and that drove a large part of this negative . So that would be an unusual in this particular quarter . Would that be correct ?Good morning . Hi . A couple of questions . One is on just the balance sheet . And as you think about your cash duration , just the profile that you have today in a rising rate environment over time . Do you expect to stay more static where you are today or any changes that we should be anticipating ?Thank you . When you think about rate sensitivity and deposit betas , you get back to really deposit flows . We continue to see increases in deposit balances , and until we see any pressure of those balances being kind of deployed back into the economy , there really shouldn\\'t be much impact on pricing . You\\'re looking at the core deposit balances and kind of what are the flows you\\'re seeing . Where is the growth coming from ? And are you seeing any pressure in the sense of thinking of those balances being deployed back into the economy ?Good morning . Brian , could you just talk a little bit about your deposit market share ? I mean , you\\'re sort of up the street or around the corner from a company that showed us this morning that they\\'re getting a lot of churn in their deposit base . So , are you able to track whether you\\'re benefiting from that ?Hi . Thank you very much for doing the call , very helpful as usual . I have a couple questions please . First is , we\\'ve seen a significant increase in floating rate issuances in the past few weeks from you and from other banks , about $10 billion or so in our models . We asked Citi and they said they\\'re seeing strong investor demand and not having to swap is attractive . I wanted to know what\\'s driving this from your side and what do you expect to do in the future ?Okay . Sure . Thank you . And the next is on these calls structures . The question is do you expect these issuances to be a default sort of or maybe bulk of the issuances in this structures going forward ? And then I would like to know your view on fair value pricing , and if you see any possibility of liquidity issues or maybe these structures trading off in a stressed market environment ?Yes , okay , great . So , the question is around callable structures that we are seeing . It\\'s a three-part question . First is , do you expect these issuances to become more of a default going forward ?So , maybe , one of the – you put up a tremendous slide that had $572 billion in liquidity and at a meeting we had last time you got a tremendous amount of questions on what rate backdrop you need to see to deploy some of that liquidity , and so maybe give us a little bit of color there ?That\\'s a good segue for my next question , every time senior management does these events , the term responsible growth keeps coming up . To someone that owns the stock or is considering owning the stock , what exactly does that mean ?So I guess my question , I just wanted to follow up , so last year it looks like you grew your average earning assets in the bank about 10% and this year based on that guidance you just gave , about 1.5%. And while I recognize that maybe you dont have enough assets for some of that – the deposits to work , there are other online brokers out there , for instance that are in the deposits much , much faster or in their securities portfolio faster . Why would you not seek to perhaps get more asset gathering from your existing clients within the bank ? To try to help ......make NII grow a little bit faster .And while your deposit costs ticked up a couple basis points last year , I assume you\\'d say on the retail side , deposit beta is very , very low ?Just one , I guess , maybe fairly detailed question . There was a drop in non-interest-bearing deposits in North America of about 5% q-over-q , drop of 6% y-over-y . Can you provide some more color as to what’s going on there , and does it tie in with anything that’s going on within the loan portfolio ?Got it . And just one quick question , if I may , just on the NII side . I know you’ve given a lot of guidance . Last quarter , you noted that we should expect to see the NIM flat year-on-year . And I’m wondering , does that still apply to the core book at least , or does that guidance no longer hold ?Hey , a couple of questions just on the non-interest-bearing deposits . I heard you earlier talk about NIB and how it’s not atypical to move from NIB to interest-bearing deposits over time . But , I’m just wondering , is there some seasonality as well in Q1 that you’re thinking happened here this year ?And is there anything on the deposit beta side that we should be thinking about , how you’re going to deal with deposit betas at this stage in the cycle ? It’s still low I know , but maybe you could give us a sense of how it’s moved up over the last couple of quarters .Yeah , okay . So basically , when we’re looking at the cost of funds on the liability side , the uptick has more to do with just a net shift to non-interest-bearing deposit – I’m sorry – a non-deposit funding . Is that a fair statement ?John , I wonder if you could talk more about that OCI risk management and the trade-off between that longer part of the curve . When we saw in your 10-K that the unrealized loss component did go up , and it seems like you did reinvest a little less this quarter , can you just talk about like the balance between your decision tree on putting more into the book here and vs . balance sheet risk and the decision tree between investment securities and maybe keeping more mortgages ?I had a question . Last quarter , you mentioned that you had proactively decided to keep the – I think it’s the non-bank balance sheet in line with September 30 levels . I’m just wondering if you persisted in that this quarter .So could you just remind us what it takes to get that approval to put more balance sheet to work in non-bank ? I’m guessing that that constraint weighed somewhat on your revenues relative to if you hadn’t had to have that constraint . And maybe give us a sense as to what kind of potential you could see as you are able to reallocate capital to that business .And that’s another three or four quarters , I’m just wondering how long you think that is .Can you guys share with us , of your average noninterest-bearing deposits , about $364B , how much is that in the commercial area vs . consumer ? And I think you mentioned on the call that you raised some deposit rates in the commercial area . Could you share with us how many basis points you lifted them up in the quarter ?And following up on the value to the customer , the compensating balances , would you expect as rates go higher that your customers , your commercial customers , will be able to lower their compensating balances amounts to still be able to receive the products you provide to them ?Okay . And I have a question for John , a follow-up for John . Deposit rates in the retail bank are not up overall , but have you had to – in certain markets or certain customer subgroups , et cetera , had to compete with deposit rates just to sort of overcome the sales fraud issues ?You touched on this earlier about your cash balances and how that plays into HQLA . Obviously , cash has gone up dramatically in this quarter . Could you talk about your targets or your long-term targets on where these cash balances could settle down over the long term ? I believe you said something around $200B back in the Investor Day last year .Okay . And when you net all those things out , do you expect that to continue to decline through 2017 or is this something longer term that you’re considering ?I wanted to focus on deposit pricing in a sense that before the Fed started moving up , deposit rates and the Fed funds rate were right on top of each other , around 15BPS . Now the effective Fed funds rate is around 90BPS and deposit costs are only 20. So that 70BPS on your $1 trillion of deposits basically gives you about $7B worth of incremental revenue that’s needed to cover the cost of branches and other things for those deposit franchise . At what point do you hit a targeted kind of spread ? And where is that , where you begin to at least break even on those costs vs . revenues ?A follow-up to that is – really what I’m getting at is last year everybody was assuming through the cycle kind of betas and we were saying that they were going to be much lower early on . We do think once you get to a certain target , usually about 100BPS of spread , you start to see a little bit more pricing pressure starting to kick in , just like you were saying , Jamie , in a sense that different products have different [indiscernible] (35:19)And the last component of this is the balances continue to grow . So as long as we’re seeing double-digit kind of sequential annualized and y-over-y growth in deposits , that provides a little bit cover in the sense of what you’re talking about as well . We may see a little bit more lag just because we’re still continuing to get deposit growth .We’ve , obviously , seen quite a bit of flattening of the yield curve , and it could reverse pretty quickly if there is progress made on the pro-growth agenda . But just talk about at what point does the flatter yield curve start to impact NIM . And I guess I’m thinking specifically if we get a couple more hikes on the short end , but the long end either doesn’t move or the long end comes down more , how do we think about the breakpoint in terms of NIM benefit in the short end being offset by the flatter yield curve ?First , a very quickie . Did you mention what NPLs you sold during the quarter and if there was any P&L impact ?No problem . I’m curious . I think we’ve all taken note of the responsible growth , what you’ve done , heard your comments on it relative to the economy . I’m curious , as we watch the industry loan growth come down for a bunch of different reasons , can BofA continue on this path ? I don’t want to say irregardless of what the industry backdrop is , but can it buck the trend of the decline in loan growth that we’re seeing in most other places ?Okay . Thanks . And then lastly , you mentioned on the call during the prepared remarks that you ‘remain mindful’ of the LCR rules as we grow deposits . Could you elaborate on your thoughts behind that ?I just wanted to follow-up on the net interest income one more time . I mean , it feels like Q2 expectation is a little bit less certainly vs . what I would have thought . And I guess what I’m trying to figure out is just some conservatism on the deposit or pricing assumption .You talk about 50%, but it’s been really insignificant so far for the Fed hikes . I’m trying to gauge , is it conservatism on that ? Is it the fact that 10-year has obviously come in a fair amount or some combination of both maybe ?Okay , understood . And then just the impact of long-term rates , I mean , obviously , the comment you made on rate leverage is for higher rates and you’re 75% levered on the short-end . But as we think about the decline here in long rates if it holds , how frame kind of the drag on that and I think it breeds in over time , obviously , not all at once .Two technical issues on the kind of net interest margin NII . When you look at the big benefit in net interest margin , it seems like you had several things like the hedge ineffectiveness and leasing that pushed the margin up , and even though you can have NII growth , your margin may even kind of just flatten out . Is there kind of a bias towards the margin just being little bit higher given some of those moving pieces this particular quarter ?I didn’t realize I was in the question queue , actually . But thanks for adding me . I was – just wanted a bit more clarity on the high interest rates and how that’s coming through . You talked about a lower deposit basically and how do you run . But then are you seeing any signs of having to pay any of that away to clients in terms of higher deposit rates ? And if not yet , then maybe how do you expect that at some point in the future ? And how – at what level would you expect that to trend towards maybe a third or maybe a 50% of the higher interest rates would have to be paid away ?Could you elaborate on the lending penetration that you have today and where this could go in the medium term ?As you think about a rising rate environment and still trying to grow the deposit base , I mean , obviously you\\'ve had a lot of growth in recent years at around $150 billion . Do you think you can still grow from here or is that more about optimizing , as we think about the rate benefit of rates going up and lying on the deposit side ?After the election of President Trump in the fall , there was talk of optimism , but the banking industry had seen loan growth slow down since then instead of pick up . What do you attribute that to ?[ph] You\\'re just growing at 6%, 8% or 9% (06:57).Yeah . Your core positioning still looks very strong to benefit from future Fed hikes , and does that [indiscernible] (14:42) sensitivity come from the deposit side or the loan side or is it really more on this deposit side ?And regarding deposit [ph] betas (15:40), what have you seen so far in terms of pressure to re-price deposits that are interest-bearing as rates have gone up ? Has that shown up yet that competitive pressure ?And what do you think will cause that to change ? Any idea in terms of having more rate hikes , or whatever it is that will create this pressure where you might have more than due today to reprice the deposit base ?Great . Last question I want to ask about , come up in the cards here once , twice . When you think about volatility , activity levels of markets being a little lower , loan growth not as much as we might have hoped as an industry . How much are kind of political chatter and what\\'s happening , maybe slowing people down or just leaving people to kind of have a risk-off mentality ? Do you see that in terms of when headlines come out , folks are pulling back or just not doing less and they\\'re just waiting for more concrete tax reform and other things to happen in D .C . first ?So in – yeah , in the U .S ., it seems like you got the big deposit base and maybe growing on the wealth management , the Citigold part of the strategy…On the other side of the balance sheet , you bought obviously GE\\'s deposit base last year . When you bought it , there might not have been much value in the deposit base given where rates are . But we\\'re starting to see kind of this breakeven with rates going up , deposits starting to be a little valuable . The outlook would suggest even more valuable , can help replace some of your wholesale funding over time as well . What\\'s the strategy and the hope on the deposit side ?Secondly , the balance sheet , I know there weren\\'t important aspects , as John mentioned that almost a third of your balance sheet is actually liquidated . How should we look that – given especially amount of -- lots of money – it\\'s taking up [indiscernible] (06:55:24) making much money now . Is it a good thing or bad thing ?Okay . What about the LCR ? Just talking about a different form of regulatory rules that you\\'re well in excess of meeting . Just wanted to understand is there an opportunity here to optimize and could you talk about how you think the LCR will traject as the Fed shrinks their balance sheet ?So it looks like you\\'re not as invested in the agency piece of the opportunity set as maybe you could be ? The rule is agency holdings have to be capped at about 40%, I think , it is of total HBLA , and it looks like you\\'re a little low there . So…There is a push amongst a bunch of guys including Giancarlo of the CFTC and Jeb Hensarling for more market liquidity . Do you think that more supply would help or do you feel like that the demand is there to ...?So , on loan growth , first quarter loan growth for the industry was quite sluggish . You experienced that as well . We\\'re seeing a little bit of pickup maybe in the [ph] HA (13:15) data so far in the second quarter . What\\'s your sense of where we are in the commercial loan growth cycle and maybe what do you make of some of the industry softness you\\'re seeing so far in the first half of the year ?Since I have been so polite so far , I want to push a little bit just on the net interest margin and the sensitivity . Other banks – I know you get this question , other banks have shown more boost to the net interest margin from the early hikes we\\'ve seen so far . Your own demonstrations of rate sensitivity of what you expect is at the low end of peers and even your range . Do you take a more balanced view than others ? Why might that be ?Yeah . And rising rates ......you\\'re positioned to benefit from rising rates ?Okay . Let\\'s just talk about the sixth goal that you have , is the shareholder value . How do you think about this ? What are the key ingredients to delivering on that ? How will you measure management\\'s delivery on shareholder value ?It does seem like there\\'s a little bit of divergence between , call it , the commercial or wholesale customer and the consumer . And obviously , Wells Fargo is very balanced on both and it feels like either the wholesale commercial customer needs to kind of start borrowing and investing more or maybe the consumer will stock , like something is got to give maybe in terms of this divergence that we\\'re seeing .So , a lot of focus on the deposit betas but obviously , deposit mix is also very important in the noninterest bearing relative to the total deposits at Wells and for the industry is either at or near all-time highs . And if you look at some of the early indicators in the HA data and the non-interest bearing deposits , not really growing when you adjust it for seasonality or the growth really slowed and you\\'re still seeing good growth elsewhere . So are you starting to see some migration from a mix point of view out of the non-interest bearing into the other buckets ?If you could comment on the liquidity position . At 17% of assets , your liquidity position is almost twice that of your peer group . Could you just explain why you\\'ve doubled the size of the liquidity position over the last four years , whether that\\'s a result of the regulatory constraints on Wells , or the strength of your deposit taking franchise , and what are the options for redeploying that liquidity other than just investing in Treasuries , I think that yields will increase ?So , if you had a freeing up of cash and liquidity , say , from the SLR , would that be something that you could use in your trading business ?I wanted to just kick off on loan growth because while it was decent number relative to what we’re seeing in the industry , the HA was a little slower than what we were looking for so could you just give us a sense as to how you think that’s going to be trajecting on a core level and then was there anything on a noncore roll-off that was impacting the number ?Okay . That’s fair . One quick follow-up . Is there any change in your loan growth outlook for the full year ? I think at Investor Day you were targeting low-single digit loan growth for the year . In terms of low-single digits , any change there after the results this quarter ?That’s great . Thanks for that . Second thing , just as the earning asset mix has changed with slower loan growth and mixing a little bit more into securities and cash , can you just help us through the dynamic of just net interest income and NIM trajectory from here ? Thanks .But do you feel confident that NII can continue to grow from here ?I wanted to focus my line of questioning in terms of the revenue progress that’s underlying your goal to get back to your efficiency range , and maybe it’s good to just jump off from Ken’s line of questioning . You mentioned that the betas are going to be a big swing factor . And I’m wondering how you’re thinking about the sensitivity of outflow in beta as the Fed begins to reduce their balance sheet and how it would impact you specifically .Thank you . Moving on to just the other side of the balance sheet , one of your competitors gave a dollar number in terms of how much liquidity had been tied up with their living will process . And I’m wondering , especially given the Treasury proposal , if you could share , at least ballpark , how much liquidity is tied up there . And I’m just I guess wondering what the opportunity set for Wells Fargo could be if reg reform does come to pass , given it seems like liquidity vs . capital seems much more of the constraint .Okay . All right . And then also on the deposit side , the decline in the deposit balances itself , can you give us similar color around the drivers there ? How much of that is at all tied to sales practice , if at all , or is it just other factors that are impacting that ?The other thing I want to ask you about was when I looked at your deposit rates , what would be your MMDA or kind of the savings a money market savings align where the majority of your deposits are , the rate has done really well . It had an increase of several base of points .The line right above it , which is really the checking account , has been going up almost with the Fed fund rate . So , it’s somewhat surprising that your checking account is going up faster than your savings account . So , there has to be kind of an anomaly in that account . Is that just more corporate related ? Is that how you classify it ? I’m just curious why that rate is moving up so fast .And the checking account is just more – is that more treasury type of products in that where you actually show interest-bearing checking as that first line on that supplement ?Okay . And I guess tied to that , the loan growth guidance you also didn’t change that . I mean , is there an expectation that you’re going to come off this high-single-digit level where you’re operating right now on an annualized basis from loan growth back to that mid-single-digit range ? Is that why you’re not moving that ? Is that one of the drivers ?Despite the link quarter annualized being in the high-single-digit range ?My first question is you’re clearly continuing to outperform your peers on your deposit cost pass-through , and I’m wondering what your thoughts are in terms of the impact of the Fed balance sheet reduction in terms of outflows for your particular deposit base and how that could shift the beta outlook .Okay , all right . Thank you . And then maybe switching gears a little . So your balances on deposits in the Fed I think are the lowest they’ve been in the last few years . Just wondering if you can talk about liquidity , sort of further liquidity deployment opportunities as you would see it and how much more is there to go so to speak ?Okay . And then I’m going to shift gears here on commercial deposits . You saw about $1.1B decline in your non-interest-bearing commercial deposits , or roughly 10% on an annualized basis . Could you speak to the shift that you’re seeing there given where the short end of the yield curve is now , and what your expectations are for outflows in non-interest-bearing deposits on the commercial side ?Maybe following up on this deposit , I think in the comment earlier it sounds like maybe we’re in the early stages of seeing a little bit of competition on the consumer side as well . I just wanted to see if you’re seeing anything of people competing for marginal depositors or any same competitors start getting promotional ? Whether anything has shifted in your outlook for how the consumer betas might end up trajectoring from here ?Okay , thanks . And then have you guys given any color on how much of the growth – you talked about the broad-based growth and taking share on the commercial lending side . How much of that came from the new growth markets vs . your legacy markets ? I know you don’t traditionally give any breakout there , but I was just curious if you could give any sense there .Okay . And then just quickly on the ECN . Out of the billion of leases that you guys acquired on the asset side , how much of that are actually operating vs . finance leases ? Are they all financed ?Just regarding the loan growth , just wanted to get a little bit more color there , in terms of your mid single-digit expectation . I mean , what’s really helping you buck the trend that we’re seeing here in the industry ? Are you seeing some of that softening at all in certain areas where it’s definitely evident ? And is it that you’re able to hold up your guidance here mainly because you expect continued progress in your newer market strategy ? Thanks .Just on the outlook on loan growth , in terms of your reply to John’s question , it seems like its PNC’s consistent strategy that really drove the outperformance especially in commercial this quarter . And I’m wondering if we could – if the logjam in Washington breaks and we do finally get some progression on some of the pro-growth policies that we expect this administration to adapt , is PNC then positioned to potentially do a little bit better than the mid single-digit number that you have given us ?Got it . And a follow-up question , this was asked of your competitor earlier . Could you give us a sense of how deposit pricing competition has been progressing and maybe separate retail and corporate , if you could ?You guys have shown lower inflows of nonperforming loans this quarter and credits quite strong obviously , but I noticed that the number one nonperforming loan now in table 10 is $51mm wholesale trade credit . Can you give us some color on that ?Okay . And then , Rob , could you help us translate your interest rate disclosures just to kind of turn that into a benefit of what the March rate hike , how much that would help you ? And if you did get one in June , how much that might help for H2?Over the course of the rest of the year ?Bill and Rob , I was wondering if I can follow-up a little bit on Bill’s kind of initial comments on the switchover to using swaps vs . securities based on kind of where the curve is and what you’re seeing in terms of the incremental opportunity . So , do you have a lot more capability to continue to add to the swaps book ? And just , in terms of , you know , are new swaps better vs . securities at this point ? Just kind of help us put that better in terms of what you’re using ?Okay . And then , so does that presume – we see all of that coming still through . Do we see that coming through the securities yield ? Or do we also see it coming on the liability side ? Just in terms of how we watch that going forward , right . It’s a little tricky to kind of see that forward in terms of how that shows through the NIM ?Right . So , I guess to sum that all up , is it fair to say that just from the combination of higher rates and some of that you should still expect to see dollars of interest income generated from the securities book rise from here ?Maybe just to riff on the idea of deposit beta , and you mentioned the difference in performance between retail and commercial . But I guess I’m curious , are you seeing any meaningful difference in the deposit beta performance in your newer markets than you are in your more legacy PNC markets ? And I guess I’m asking because of the market share differential there could cause you a little bit different performance in terms of deposit beta .I guess just a quick follow-up . On the securities yields , thinking about where that Q1 2017 yield is for total securities . I guess with the roll-on , roll-off after the adjustments you’ve made with the swaps , I guess are we going to have some pressure going forward or are you at a point where anything you’re putting on now might actually be accretive to that , the book yield ?Yeah . Exactly , exactly . Thanks for the color Bill . I guess maybe other question , a follow-up on that is , as you mentioned end of period balances at the Fed went up . So with the 10-year kind of pulling back here , is there any appetite to take some more duration with that excess liquidity ?Great . And if I can turn your attention into the I&L division . You\\'ve already spoken about the NII strength , and you said that the figure is more than $400 million . I\\'m just trying to get a feeling on the recurring part that relates to your increased lending through corporate and private banking versus the standard kind of one-off interest that\\'s coming from your equity investments . Could you kind of give us an indication whether you start seeing more and more recurring NII hitting that division ?Good morning . Thanks , Marty . So a couple of quick questions here . On the deposit front , I know you\\'ve been growing in kind of consumer , I guess we would call those consumer deposits , and I know that you haven\\'t really been growing markets that much . So what other businesses are being funded by those deposits ? Which other businesses are utilizing that deposit funding ? Are they supporting I&L ?Hi . Thanks . I appreciate all the detail on the net interest income discussion . One piece of it on the repo borrowings part of it financing the equity financing side . I\\'m curious if you think of that as a little episodic and you kind of just go with the flow or is it more a permanent part of the strategy where you\\'re using your strong balance sheet to help grow ? The tag along to that is if it\\'s more permanent , why do with the repo is that more expensive ?Got it . I appreciate that . Then the tag along for net interest income guidance is as you mentioned very low deposit beta on the Consumer side , just 2 basis points up in the quarter . Is there a point in time where you expect that to accelerate over the next couple of hikes ? I know we all kind of ask the same thing each quarter but it\\'s amazingly low .Okay , great . Thanks . Good morning . May be getting back to the deposit question . You guys are growing 9% in the Consumer book , better than the industry despite holding low , obviously reflecting your mix . How far do you think – A , I guess , can you give your sense of what you think is driving sort of that market share ? And is this something where you\\'re willing to test the patience of your customers to lag deposit rates until growth slows more materially ? How do we think about what your decision making process is in terms of rates in the Consumer book ?Good morning . Just a couple of quick follow-ups . Did you guys disclose the debt hedge ineffectiveness drag that was in net interest income this quarter ?Okay . Does that show up in the 10-Q or can\\'t remember where we got that from ?Hi . Good morning . First , wanted to follow-up on the net interest income , the 100 basis point – the benefit of the $3.2 billion you get from 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve , you mentioned it\\'s primarily sensitive to the short-end . I think last quarter you gave a sort of a 75:25 split between short- and long-end . Is that still a good rule of thumb to use ?Okay . So , a little bit more skewed to the long-end than the disclosure in 1Q .Paul , wanted to – sort of a second question – look at you know we\\'ve talked about you know the core , core , core and that the company has taken actions to try to drive that . But really we\\'ve had an historical shift in the liquidity premium coming out of the financial crisis and just having rates at zero . So hasn\\'t a lot of this shift been related to just the environment more than really company actions ? And what we\\'re seeing has been the de-risking now that GWIM deposits are starting to move out , is that the first sign of you know the rerisking or the customer\\'s willing to take a little bit more risk and drop that liquidity premium ? So I\\'m kind of watching for that first sign of the customer behavior beginning to change .During the quarter , Jamie had made a comment on potential disruptions related to the unwinding of the U .S . balance sheet . And I’m just curious , it’s supposed to be slow and deliberate , but I’m curious how you think that impacts liquidity , the yield curve , trading , deposit betas . And is there anything you can do to protect JPMorgan against those disruptions ?So thanks for that clarity on the trading-related NII . I wanted to follow up on the loan yield side , which not much moved . You mentioned the $75mm in Mortgage . Can you just help us walk through the loan portfolio and whether you’re seeing the assets move and whether there’s a lag or whether there’s any spread compression underneath that ?Okay . So would that naturally say that as we go forward that should – if they’re moving the right way , mix adjusted , they should move the right way from here ?I just wanted to follow up to the questions that Glenn and Ken had on margin . Marianne , could you give us a little bit of insight on how deposit betas trended Wholesale vs . Retail during the quarter ? And also just going back to your comments , if the Fed balance sheet reduction drives Wholesale deposits out of the system , can we assume that that should not affect deposit betas negatively for JPMorgan ?So , Marianne , I wanted to start off with a question on liquidity . You spoke of how the Fed balance sheet unwind should have little impact on your LCR . But just given the strength of your liquidity position and the significant excess reserves that you have at the Fed , how should we be thinking about the current capacity to deploy some of that excess into higher-yielding MBS ? And maybe what’s your appetite to redeploy , just given some of the tougher liquidity treatment for agency MBS , in particular ?John , thank you so much for the outlook on net interest income for the back half of the year . I\\'m wondering if you could give us a little bit more of your insight . Two of your peers mentioned that they anticipate corporate or wholesale deposits to outflow as a result of Fed balance sheet reduction . And I\\'m wondering what Citigroup\\'s outlook is for how sensitive your deposit base could be from outflow and the back of Fed balance sheet reduction ?Got it , and just one more quick one for me . Just on liquidity , which has been certainly a popular topic ahead of the Fed balance sheet unwind . Looking at your LCR , it\\'s at a very healthy 123%. And despite significant cushion , you\\'ve talked about resolution planning as a binding constraint on liquidity deployment . I\\'m just wondering whether you believe – or what you think is at least an appropriate LCR target for the firm , and how we should think about maybe some excess capacity for deployment as the Fed begins to unwind the balance sheet , maybe providing some opportunities to deploy some of that excess cash in higher yielding MBS .Okay . But if I\\'m understanding you correctly that your comments , John , suggest that you need to manage to around 120% liquidity in order to meet the standards for the resolution plan that you hold yourselves to and hopefully the Fed and the FDIC will approve .Hi . Thanks . Good morning . Good afternoon , just a question or two on the loans and the loan yields . You guys showed your pretty good loan growth , but yet you did mention that loan yields were down a little bit , and you had some mix as far as the NIM is concerned . But I\\'m just wondering . Can you help us distill whether the decline in loan yields was related to the ongoing Corporate/Other runoff , and/or is there just a different mix in terms of the – it looks like it\\'s card that\\'s growing the most , so I\\'m just wondering what\\'s happening underneath the surface , especially with a couple of rate hikes in between the last couple quarters .And so maybe bluntly , if we get a couple more hate rate hikes , do you capture the majority of it ? Even without , as you said , a rate story , do you have to hike along the way ? Are the clients looking to participate in that move up ?Okay , great . And then second , in the supplement package you gave us , on page 5 you gave us the total loans of the organization . And could you share with us some color on , and I may have missed this and I apologize if I did , why the corporate loans were down 37% or so year over year , and a little color behind that , really good growth you\\'re seeing on the wealth management side , where those loans were up 20%?Thank you . Maybe a technical one on this . That balance sheet reduction , have you changed assumptions ondeposit outflows and how you\\'re managing LCR and the mix in HQLA now we\\'ve all seen the disclosures ? ThankYou have the FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee] meeting next week . How do you see this whole balancesheet normalization playing out and particularly with respect to both the banking industry , the interest rate market ,and how do you think this impacts banks and liquidity and JPMorgan ?With respect to I would say core loan growth , you guys have outperformed the industry , although I think even yearto date running a bit lower than what you thought at the start of the year . Just maybe talk to in terms of whatyou\\'re seeing in the lending environment , how you\\'re thinking about the back half of this year , and as you thinkMaybe we can switch gears and talk about the deposit side of the balance sheet . Deposit betas I think havecertainly been I think lower than people anticipated , and that still continues to be the case . I guess particularly toget back to the QE question is , as the environment progresses from here , how do you see that playing out ?Here we go . Here\\'s the question . Do you own the stock overweight , smart weight , underweight or not ? To bevoted one . Interesting . We got to go back and check this , but this you either maybe the most owned stock so far ,The next question would be improvement in which factor [indiscernible] (23:53) when you\\'re increasing yourexposure , again the same six responses we\\'ve used so far .So profitability metrics followed by net interest income . And interesting , I think you guys have screened to kind ofI guess in that context , Paul , maybe just give us some context . Obviously , maybe your view of the overalleconomic environment; you obviously meet with clients , see customer activity , and maybe just kind of talk someSo you guys released the living will plan a couple weeks ago , which had a lot of incremental information , which has been useful . There’s been a lot of liquidity prepositioned across the organization now . Can you talk a little bit about that vs . LCR and how you think about liquidity and binding constraints in this new world , and how you maybe see LCR coming down over time as you optimize ?Got it . And it’s still a little early days in terms of trying to quantify some of that , it sounds .And then question on the support agreement and the prepositioning of assets in this . People kind of think about what risks could potentially come out of that . I assume that as the parent is down-streaming to three inter-company loans down to the Citicorp IHC , that the kind of interest rate and maturity dates are similar to the end securities that are issued , just to ensure proper flow of liquidity back up to the parent , in addition to some of the other mechanisms that are in place ? Is that the right way to think about how those inter-company loans work ?And then one security question . So post CCAR it seems like we often get questions around the old legacy grandfathered trust preferred securities , [ph] the Citi ends (17:16). I think they’ve been callable for a few years now , so you’ve had the opportunity to put and to redeem them . And it hasn’t happened yet .So seems like the view then is that it’s economically attractive to leave those outstanding . And I think there’s some capital and returns reasons that justify that . But I think there seems to be , from time to time , confusion in the market . Can you talk a little bit about why , to date at least , that security has been viewed as something that is economically attractive to leave outstanding ?Okay . That’s very helpful . Thank you . Second question around the margin and a two-parter; first , we saw one trust bank yesterday have a real outflow of noninterest bearing deposits . Your experience is y-over-y down about 10%, not as much in the past quarter . How are you looking at how that’s going to develop over the next few quarters ? How is that going to impact your margin , number one ?And then two , I know in the prior call , you said that your outlook on the margin is not necessarily rate dependent . And you’re not baking in a lot of rate increases , one this year .But which part of the curve is most impactful for you ? I think a lot has been written – or a lot of people look at long rates , but is it 2s [years], 5s [years]? 3s [years], 5s [years]? 1s [year], 3s [years]? What should we be looking at when we look at the possible implications for your margin going forward ? And I realize that can change from time-to-time .And you’re calling that five years and in ? Or three years and in ? Or right around the three-year point ? Just to narrow it down .So in terms of NIM impact , when I look at this type of flow vs . you had mentioned larger cash – keeping larger cash balances and eventually optimizing them for the next couple quarters . Would it be this or the optimization of the cash balances that would have more of an impact on the NIM ?Okay . And just the last – the second question I had was in terms of the issuance for – at the bank level in terms of bank notes and securitizations , it was $20B vs . $15B in Q1. Is that more bank notes or is it more securitizations ?And for the color regarding the IHC structure as well as deposits . Just following up on Robert’s question , roughly two-thirds of Citi’s deposits are corporate . And out of that , TTS makes up the biggest chunk . How should we look at the stickiness of that deposit base , generally speaking ?Thank you for that . And then , given how flat the yield curve is and also the tightness of the sub senior spread differential , any thoughts on kind of preloading up on subordinated debt or extending maturities ?I will add my thanks to you both for hosting the call . We really do appreciate it . And I’m going to have to go back to Brian’s question on the [ph] ends (54:06).As much as I know you’re going to hate that , John . But as you said it is a popular topic with investors out there .So if I just go back to your comments . And I think about the associated quarterly interest expense you pay on the [ph] ends (54:20), which is increasing with LIBOR moving higher . And then if I think about the roughly $880mm of common equity associated with that security on the balance sheet , and I try to square that with your drive to improve profitability over time . Just doing some back of the envelope math , it seems like it could add 50BPS of RoTCE on an ongoing basis , after you take that one quarter hit to redeem it , which you know all of us are going to graciously call a one-time non-core hit .Is there something I’m missing from the outside ? Especially for a security that gets no TLAC credit . If we think about where your Tier 1 position is vs . your stated target , it’s hopefully above that . I mean is there some accounting ? Is there some other reason that we’re missing from the outside ? Just any more color there . Because it just doesn’t seem to jive with your stated target to improve profitability .And we\\'ve got a lot of questions in here , but you can – so deposits , I hope we get this right can you speak to the bank\\'s positioning with respect to deposits ? Is the Fed normalizing the balance sheet ? That\\'s very typical , here we go .Right . Okay . Fair enough . Maybe sticking with sort of NII and maybe a little bit of a longer-term outlook in cards , I think your net interest margin there , which you\\'ve obviously gone through in detail on what\\'s been impacting it , I think you\\'re down about 8.6% this quarter . A year ago , it was closer to 9.4%. When do we start to see or if you have a sense of when that starts to inflect ? And can you get back to that 9% plus number over time ?I wanted to follow up to your responses , Marianne , on no pressure on deposit pricing . I\\'mwondering if you could , especially in light of your deposit growth strength [audio gap] (21:00) consumer , give us a sense on how repricing trends are today in terms of the consumer wealth management versus wholesaleAnd my follow-up question on that is , you\\'re one of the few firms that have been really talking aboutanticipating the impact from a Fed balance sheet reduction over the next several years . And the question I often get from investors is , obviously , in particular , retail is valuable not just for the price of it today , but on an LCR basis .How would you respond to the question , given the 6% growth in digital in the consumer bank and 12% growth in mobile , does technology help with the stickiness of the consumer deposits ? Or does it potentially aid in theAnd in terms of the loan growth , I think it\\'s completely normal to see some moderation and you\\'re stilldoing reasonably better than the industry . I\\'m curious , on the main source of maybe the moderation ticking down a little bit . And then more importantly , is it too soon to ask if any of this talk on tax reform and decent economic data is having a pickup in the conversations on the loans growth side ?And then just a follow-up on the rate sensitivity . You mentioned before or you reiterated before your moreleverage through the short end of the curve . If you get continued increases on the short end of the curve , but the 10-year doesn\\'t go anywhere , is that still NIM-accretive as it\\'s been thus far ?Got it . Okay . And Marianne , just wanted to follow up on some of the discussion around excess liquiditymanagement and I appreciate the fact that you guys certainly want to be conservative in thinking about duration and maybe taking a more holistic view of the asset side of the balance sheet . But looking at the LCR disclosures and just given the stark contrast in terms of how much you have parked in the way of excess reserves and relatively low levels of MBS compared with your peers , how you\\'re thinking about duration management and whether you do have additional capacity to actually remix some of that cash of the Fed into higher-yielding MBS , especially as we think about the Fed balance sheet unwind dynamics ?And then flipping over to deposit growth . What we saw is you kind of layer deposits in institutional deposits ,corporate deposits , retail deposits . We\\'re starting to see a little bit of a pressure in the sense of institutionalCorporate and retail still show a lot of strength . Just kind of think about that dynamic , because that\\'s really where you begin to see pressure on betas is typically when you see pressure on volumes . And we just haven\\'t seen it in the core deposit base yet .So a premium for liquidity that\\'s been kind of pushed into those core customers from corporate and retail seems to be pretty persistent , which will mean the duration and the length and the growth of deposits will be much longer than what we probably anticipated before ?And just one last question , a follow-up on the revenue side of the 2018 efficiency equation , are there idiosyncraticcatalysts for the margin decline that you’d like to point out that impacted the performance for this year ? Or maybea better way to ask , if the Fed does raise rates in December , could you walk us through what the impact would befor Q1 2018 that would be perhaps different from what we saw this quarter ?Hey . Can you talk a little bit about just loan growth expectations ? I know , John , in your prepared remarks , youtalked through a couple of the buckets where you’re continuing to let things roll off . But obviously , we’re seeingthe period end is coming lower than the averages in part because of that . Can you just talk about end demandand try to separate end demand and customer growth from perhaps any lagging ramifications of retail sales andslower account growth in terms of how you expect loans to [ph] traject (43:10) going forward ? Thanks ....when do we see kind of a bottoming in loan growth and how much of that kind of let go part is weighing on theOkay . And then if I could just dig in on the commercial business specifically , the biggest of the loan buckets on theWholesale side . Even maybe some granularity there in terms of – I know the specifics that John mentioned , butobviously , C&I has slowed overall . And what are you just seeing in terms of customer demand and where thatOkay . Just on auto specifically , I know you mentioned your actions that you’ve been taking in the auto portfolio .What would drive you to get back into a growth mode there ? I know there has been some chatter around demandpicking up , and obviously , the hurricanes have had some impact .Right . And so , that you get down to the three by the end of 2018 or is that 2019?Just wanted to – sorry , but I just want to kick the dead horse on loan growth one more time , and I’ll be quick onthis one . So , the way we should think about it with loan growth and the potential impact of the sales practice andauto insurance issues , that if those issues did not happen at all , if you never had the sales practice issue emergenor the auto insurance gap and CPI issue and all that , loan growth headwinds that you’re seeing right now , thisdecline in commercial , et cetera , that still would have happened ?Hey . What I wanted to focus on is your deposit beta has been higher than the peers , which is abnormal comparedto your history . And that has really been , I think , reflective of you wanting to , especially with corporate and wealthmanagement customers , not give them any other reason in this period to look anywhere else . So you’ve beendefensive in your deposit pricing , which has not been the case in the past . You’ve been much more offensive andaggressive in being able to hold back those deposits .When you look at your asset structure , because of the duration that that would have had you to assume on yourdeposit side over time , you would have extended your assets . So what you’re kind of getting is a fundamentalshift in your deposit beta , which doesn’t reflect on your asset side . So you got almost a mismatch and I’m justwondering if that’s the way to kind of think about this , and is this how and why we’re not seeing the marginexpansion that we’re seeing in some of the other banks ?And I was thinking that , that might be temporary in the sense that you used to be able to be the most aggressivelager , which helped you to be able to expand when everybody else was expanding but also maintain a highermargin because you have extended your duration on your assets prudently . So that defended your margin in adeclining rate environment but takes away a little of the punch on the way up that you used to be able to make byjust being half of what everybody else did in deposit increases .Hey . Good morning . So yeah , two quick questions I think . When you looked at the C&I growth , I know it wasdown , I know you highlighted some of the declines and some of what was offset by growth in the presentation butthat’s still only accounts for $1B of the $3B decline . So can you just highlight where the rest of the decline cameAnd in light of some of your peers were reporting really strong growth in large Corporate Banking , how did largeOkay . And then on the efficiency ratio for 2018, I know you’ve been saying that you hope the lending growth picksup and that you’re optimistic it will but , I mean , what kind of lending growth is in the budget for you to hit that59%? I mean , can you still hit the 59% goal with 1% loan growth or 2% loan growth ?And then separately , just on the loan growth side , just wanted to get an idea , if you could help us size up the newmarket initiative . How much in loan balances do you have in these newer markets right now , and how much of theloan growth that you saw in the quarter came from this expansion into some of the corporate relationships inHey . I\\'ll kick off with my typical question and then a follow up . But the typical question is excess liquidity , you\\'vegot a decent amount , I know that rates were not that attractive this quarter . And so you\\'re kind of , I dont know ,hoarding a little bit on the cash side . Could you give us a sense as to what kind of rates curve , shape you\\'relooking for , and how you think about the Fed balance sheet normalization ? I know it\\'s not going to impact yourdeposits too much , but how are you thinking about whether or not that gives you opportunities on theAnd then how are you thinking about the loan-to-deposit ratio ? I think , you\\'re currently running at about 85%. Iknow it\\'s a new world with the LCR and everything , so it\\'s hard to use history as a guide . But just want tounderstand how you\\'re thinking about managing the loan growth to deposits , and how are you thinking about theJust a question on some of the loan trends this quarter . On both an average and spot basis , your loan growth wasbest-in-class . I\\'m wondering , under the financial services category , I understand that some of that growth hasbeen for warehouse financing for CRE , and I\\'m wondering , if that level of growth in that category is sustainable . Isthere a seasonality that we should think about going forward ?Got it . And my follow-up question is , Bill , since after the crisis , PNC has been known to manage exposures verywell and not grow for the sake of growth . And I\\'m wondering , and you\\'re also one of the few regional bank CEOsthat has been talking about the Fed balance sheet reduction . There\\'s been a lot of discussion on the impact [ph]on (21:37) deposits , but I\\'m wondering if you could give us a sense on how you\\'re anticipating the impact tocommercial real estate . If we do get some steepness to the curve , how you think that would impact , first , growthGot it . And then one quick follow up . Rob , I dont know if you got this earlier on deposit betas . Just on the retailside , have you guys seen anything in terms of deposit beta , just on retail banking , and then if you\\'d just commentGot it . And in wealth management we\\'ve seen some other banks kind of pushing up their ...Good morning . In regards to your auto loan growth , you guys have been outpacing most peers for past fewquarters . Despite what we\\'ve seen is a decline in the overall new car sales and auto originations . You\\'veobviously pulled back in 2014 and 2015 as the industry was getting very heated , and have remained in the space .Could you just talk about the state of the auto industry , and what your expectations are for loan growth goingOkay . And then a follow up on some on the commercial real estate . You\\'ve seen quite a bit of increase in yourasset yields on commercial real estate , up almost 40 basis points over last year . Could you talk about the shift inyour book , and where new money yields are [indiscernible] (00:32:50)?To follow up on the balance sheet , you guys talked about kind of restarting little purchasing on the securities , andobviously you\\'ve had good loan growth , which has been matched nicely by the deposit growth . As we go forward ,and I know you\\'ve talked about this a little bit , again , I just want to get your updated thoughts , do you anticipateseeing much mix shift on the balance sheet as we look ahead and effects from Fed balance sheet normalization ,and are the deposits you\\'re getting still just coming from new customers , or are you still getting more money fromYeah . And let me – I can qualify my second question more . I was more thinking about , are you seeing mix shift ,meaning , are you seeing customers come out of noninterest bearing into interest bearing ? I know we\\'re seeingBut growing your commercial customers , and I\\'m more wondering just about where the incremental deposit isgoing as far as the deposit mix . That\\'s really what I meant to get at .Yeah . And the last little one , on the earnings credit rate , are we seeing any of that inside the treasurymanagement business , are you starting to give back some more there at all ?Rob , you mentioned about the more rapid growth you\\'re seeing in some of your newer territories that you\\'ve gotinto de novo , like Chicago on the commercial loans side . Can you share with us how you\\'re achieving – I knowyou\\'re coming off a low base , but how are you achieving that faster loan growth in these new territories ?Right . And without naming names , do you guys find when you had these successes , you\\'re taking the businessaway from middle market type things , or are these very large universal type banks , where you seem to be gettingOkay . And just one quick follow up for Paul . Paul , you mentioned in Global Banking that all categories of loans grew except CRE . Is that a self-selection ? Or could you just expand on that a bit ?Good morning . A little drilling down on your comments on deposit cost drive . So we go from , I guess , 8 basis points last year to 24 basis points this – or 11 basis points to 24 basis points over the last quarter . How much of that increase is what you mentioned in Wealth Management ? I heard your comments on the bringing them a competitive cash alternative . I\\'m just curious , is it CD versus money market ? Is it all coming from current clients ? Got you . And so there\\'s – a competitor or two had put out some high-priced or high-rate CDs in an effort to gather new client money . This is more of just compensating clients for being good clients , sharing a little bit of the love with them .Yeah . Your branch account continues to go down , I guess , down 3% year-over-year . But deposits are up 4% year-over-year . And I\\'m trying to get a distinction between retention of deposits when you close branches and retention of customers . Because according to your 10-K from 2015 to 2016, the number of accounts declined by about 2%, but at the same time , deposits continued to grow just like the entire decade . So my question is what is your retention rate of deposits ? And what is the retention rate of customers when you close a branch today ? And why the difference ?                                   So I am not sure if you can disclose this . So what is retention of deposits when you close a branch today ? And what was it a few years ago ? Thanks for that color , Brian . And so my understanding then is that if we do see rate hikes from here , because much of this increase was a function of your efforts to catch up with the competition , that should we see an in-trajectory increase ? Or how should we think about the outlook from here if we get additional rate hikes ?Good morning . I was wondering if you could just elaborate a bit in terms of what you\\'re seeing on the loan demand side , both on the commercial corporate as well as the consumer . And obviously , the industry has slowed down overall . You made some comments about seeing more activity in pockets of consumer . And then along with that , just your outlook for loan growth in the near term here .And then as we think about the deposit growth driving the balance sheet growth , you\\'ve got this flatter yield curve and some people – my personal view is if you get additional increase in the short end , you might have further flattening .  I\\'m just wondering the thought process to keep building the securities book and the mortgage book , you\\'re seeing some banks shrinking the securities book and building cash instead , and obviously , there\\'s the cost of doing that . But just the thought process to keep building securities here as the curve has flattened pretty meaningfully .Yes . I guess the point I was getting at is you\\'re paying up a little bit on the deposit side in the Wealth Management business . You\\'re paying up a little bit on the Global Banking side . And on the one hand , you can afford to pay up to help out the customers and keep them using our products , but at the same time with a flatter yield curve , it just makes it less economical to do so , I would think .Morning . The first\\xa0question\\xa0was\\xa0on\\xa0the\\xa0first\\xa0mortgage\\xa0production\\xa0that\\xa0you\\xa0mentioned . You said that you\\'re putting most of that on the balance sheet . Could you just give kind of a description of the type of paper that it is ? Is it conforming ? And then what\\'s that do to the duration of the loan book for that consumer ?Maybe a quick question on rate sensitivity . It looks like it didn\\'t change despite absorbing another rate hike this past quarter . Is that sort of indication that you\\'ve gotten slightly more asset-sensitive as the quarter went on ? Or how do we think about the flat rate sensitivity ? Was there any change in the short- versus long-end sensitivity ?      Very good . And then just finally , Paul , you mentioned , I think , on the call about the higher rep-and-warranty expense . Can you guys kind of frame for us what\\'s left there ? And do you – obviously , I\\'m assuming we\\'re toward the tail end , but do you guys know about what\\'s left ?Okay . Great . Thanks for that . And okay , so the BDP came at the end of the quarter , so there might be a littleOkay . So your U .S . bank deposits are back to $154B , and that’s almost the size of the 11th largest bank . And Iknow this is a new realm for you guys . But what is your deposit beta on those $154B of deposits ? And what I’mreally trying to get to is the first couple questions . What should we expect in the future ? What do you haveplanned as far as future CD campaigns ? Or a little bit more on your strategy .Good morning . You mentioned a little bit of a detail within the loan growth this quarter on an earlier question . But I guess just bigger picture , what kind of goalposts will you be providing to us on the $5 billion of revenue targets as we think out the next couple of years here ?I was hoping you could maybe unpack a bit the $5 billion of incremental equity tied to your tier growth targets . I know we\\'ve got – I think you laid out $28 billion of loan balances , but I\\'m guessing there\\'s probably some balance sheet consumption on your trading initiatives , too . So , could you maybe just give us an idea about that attribution ?Hey . Good morning . Maybe you could just talk about your deposit gathering efforts , how that\\'s progressing so far ?All right . And what were the flows like in the quarter ?I was going to ask two questions . One was when you think of the investing and lending , especially on the equities side , where you said you all , given the market conditions – or you said kind of harvesting aggressively , is part of that related to – because if you look at the increase here , about $1.8 billion increase in what you had in the equities security gains , there\\'s about a $1.3 billion decline in fixed income . So , you kind of have an offsetting effect with those two things , which is letting your overall revenue still grow this year .So , I just didn\\'t know if you all were doing that just because of market conditions . Are you trying to balance the mix ? And so what , should we expect this when we have some volatility in other sides of the business ?Always appreciate it . So my first question is when we’re looking at the ongoing LIBOR debate and the potential changes to the base rate , how are you thinking about this within your documents ? I know your recent issuance maintained the old language . But could you just go into how you’re thinking about the recent changes in competitors’ language with calculation agent and looking at market rates and how you might address this in the future ?On slide 13, Citi has $261B of level one HQLAs . And as we think about the Fed unwinding its balancesheet , be it at a snail pace , how do you think about the mix of the level one HQLAs ? Will you just swap from oneAnd then on the deposit front , as we see interest rates rise; in Citi’s case , the push to a Citigold and then the change in mix from deposits to AUM , are you seeing any deposits re-pricing higher ? Or any particular type of deposit category that’s re-pricing higher vs . others that are just price takers ?And then lastly , so you guys were one of the pioneers of issuing this TLAC eligible debt that can becalled with a year before maturity . So is there any sense in putting in these early call dates into your bank notesGood morning , gentlemen . Thanks for doing the call and happy Friday to everybody . Following up a little bit onPri\\'s questions . If I think about 2018 issuance and I know John Ryan made the comment that it should or coulddecelerate a little bit towards more traditional net issuance norms . But if I think about the biggest driver beingbalance sheet growth that you just mentioned , Jon , and we think about solid loan growth and the potential forcapital markets activity to hopefully pick up for all of us , it seems like you ought to be a pretty meaningful netissuer for the foreseeable future at least in 2018. Is that fair ?Okay . Perfect . Thanks for that . And then just as a follow-up . In terms of the type of issuance , obviously , you allhave been issuing a decent amount of callables , but are very well-positioned versus TLAC . And then , I think thegeneral consensus is that NSFR never really gets finalized here . So can you just talk about your appetite tocontinue issuing callables , especially if the market starts to demand a little bit more premium for selling thatA couple of questions on growth going forward . You\\'ve done very well with your secured lending product . Nowthat you\\'ve seen the greater strides , how do you see that kind of growth going forward ? You mentioned thatclients\\' cash is at an all-time low . So how comfortable are you to continue to have them essentially lever theiraccounts ? And also on the lending side , and it\\'s a tax question . With companies being restricted on deductibility , particularly high-yield companies , can you see a shift from them out of high-yield bonds and into high-yield loans ? And how does that impact you as your bank isn\\'t as big as some of your competitors ? And then I have a follow-up question .But you are not capacity-constrained if you saw a significant percentage of the people who you did debtunderwriting for in the past two or three years , if they wanted to roll that into a loan , you could participate ?So in terms of sentiment from large corporate and sentiment from middle-market customers , what are they telling you in terms of timing of strategic actions from here ? Why is the demand for financing , I think less than people had expected ? What\\xa0about on\\xa0the\\xa0consumer\\xa0side ? What is you - obviously , harder to pick up sentiment , but what does your data tell you about that ? I thought the way you explained the balance sheet transformation at Wells during Investor Day was interesting , right . And then so because everybody remembers Wells is having an industry-leading NIM when they think about historical  Wells performance . And when we separated out looking at your earning assets , even with the drag of purchase accounting , your loan yields actually declined the least among peers so that\\'s holding in well . So that implies to me that a lot of the drag on – at least on the asset side is liquidity . So can you separate out in terms of how much excess liquidity you have today ? To the best that you can , what sort of the regulatory constraint liquidity that you have to hold versus what is sort of smart ALCO ?As we look forward in terms of further changes to asset mix , is there anything strategically that you\\'re thinking of doing that could change your asset mix ? And I guess , I\\'m really more specifically asking you have tons of leverage capital . And for a bank of your size , you\\'re not as big in terms of financial institution clients . Maybe give us your thoughts there ?So , you\\'ve been pretty clear on sort of the loan mix transformation , more to wholesale versus consumer in terms of just the mix . There\\'re some idiosyncratic elements that sort of drove balances down and I\\'m wondering sort of where we are in the , cleanup is the wrong word , but where we are in terms of having those factors drive growth ?Wells Fargo balance sheet transformation , top retail deposit gather in the United States , but can you just remind us how much your deposit base has evolved since the 2004/2006 rate cycles in terms of composition ?So , I wanted to also ask you about what I thought was a very compelling statistic that your business contributes 44% of the consolidated company\\'s deposits . And we\\'ve heard a lot of talk about the value for retail deposits in a rising rate environment , but I actually think that TTS deposits are very undervalued and so maybe share with the audience how TTS deposits from volume and rate perspective typically behaves in a rising rate environment .Okay . So , can we talk a bit about loan growth ? So , I think loan growth has obviously been a lot weaker than many people were expecting . I think for Wells , in particular , you\\'ve been running slightly below the industry average; part of that is auto lending . I think your decision to pull back is well understood . But corporate lending has also been a bit weaker than the market . Can you talk a bit about that dynamic and how do you view the risk/reward in the auto market today ? I know you talked about growing the portfolio as you head into next year .\\xa0And\\xa0your\\xa0base\\xa0case\\xa0for\\xa0rate\\xa0hikes\\xa0as\\xa0we\\xa0head\\xa0into\\xa0next\\xa0year ? So , you are expecting the curve to continue to flatten before rate hikes ?Okay , great . So , perhaps we can talk a little bit about rate sensitivity . So , I guess two areas . The first is on deposit betas . They\\'ve obviously started to pick up more recently , but it does seem very concentrated in both corporate and high net worth . Retail deposit pricings remain very , very stable . What do you think it takes for retail deposit pricing to start to move and what are your expectations around deposit betas as we get the next two , three , four rate hikes ?I know this is difficult to answer , but conceptually , 100 basis points of rate hikes have led to about 12% net interest income growth , about , in this quarter , 20 basis points of net interest margin expansion . When you think about the value of rate hikes from here , how quickly do you think it will fade relative to what we\\'ve seen if we use that as the benchmark ?Okay , thank you . And then maybe just a quick follow-up here on the NII question . Where do you think you are in the securities-based loan opportunity or penetration there ? And then just kind of bigger picture just given where the interest rate curve is and what we’re seeing happen on kind of a longer end , what would make you think differently about the duration of the book or if that is an opportunity ?Okay . And your base case for interest rate rises for next year ?Okay . So perhaps we can talk a little bit about loan growth ? So I think what\\'s a little more surprising features of what\\'s happened this year has been the slowdown both in corporate loan growth but also in some of the consumer categories this year . Can you talk a little bit about some of the dynamics in the lending markets broadly and specific to what you\\'re seeing in your portfolios ?Right . Okay . So let\\'s talk about asset sensitivities . So , net interest income is up about 8% this year . How should we think about the value of incremental rate hikes from here , especially against the backdrop that we did start to see deposit betas move up quite sharply following the last rate hike ?Right . So , what do you think it takes for core retail deposits to start to re-price with having the market being stable across the industry ?Okay . That’s helpful . And then just separately , on the retail deposit side , you mentioned essentially no repricing there and it’s consistent , I think , with what we’re seeing for mostly your big peers , but just wondering what your thoughts are in terms of when there does start being a little bit of upward pressure there , being the biggest deposit player , you might be one of the kind of setters in the price there as we think about rates going forward .Last follow-up , just on that last point , Brian . A lot of investors have voiced concern that all of the Internet digital banking will be the demise of the deposits , that deposits will flee more quickly . And what’s your short answer to that concern ?If I could follow-up on the loan side , 6% y-over-y in the core business , pretty decent rate , and you’re seeing growth across . Just wondering what your expectations for loan growth are as you look out ? And in a bigger sense , any sense of just movement in commercial and corporate America in terms of starting to think about investing more in their businesses ?And , Paul , is there any change in the rate of run-off in the All Other bucket from that $71B bucket ? How fast are you expecting that to still run-off ?I was just making sure those were two separate items and that reconciles where I was getting to . And then , if you look at the securities portfolio , you had two things that kind of popped up . One , you took just a very modest or slight loss in security sales . And then , also , your AOCI , you had the OCI adjustment as rates went higher that you mentioned earlier . Will you be actively restructuring because it does kind of drop through capital anyway and taking those losses as you have the opportunity to kind of round up earnings ? So , I just was curious how aggressive you wanted to be in that kind of push .Got you . And just one of the things we’re anticipating is that banks can actually accelerate the benefit as we do any get uptick on the back end of the curve by doing some of that aggressive restructuring . So , I just was curious if you had been kind of thinking of that or kind of moving in that direction .Yes , I know you didn’t want to give any commentary about deposit betas in the quarter in that , but what’s the ability that you have to remix ? I notice the LCR is up to 125%. So , to the extent you don’t want to get as competitive on deposit rates , I mean , is there still plenty of opportunity to remix from short term into loans ?Got you . Okay . Last one . Average loan growth in ICG was good , 8%, and I think no matter what form it comes in , it\\'s typically pretty good . But I\\'m just curious how much of it we should think of as like facilitation loans , things like Aramco , things like hedge fund leverage , which are good things – I dont want to make it like they\\'re bad – versus a traditional corporate borrowing money and building something ? Just curious on that type of mix .Got it . And John , just a follow-up question . You mentioned earlier that for every quarter that we have an additional 25 basis points on the short end , that\\'s about $80 million a quarter , in your modeling what does that assume for deposit costs ?Okay . Last thing then , just on the loan yields overall , I know there\\'s a lot of moving parts also quarter-to-quarter and all that . But just on the loan yields , the decline this quarter of 13 basis points , I know probably some of that is the teaser balances . But how much is mix and how much is volume ? Can you help us understand what the moving parts are of loan yields ? Thanks .Great . Just to follow up on , seemed like deposit betas actually slowed this quarter . And what you\\'re expecting that to sort of reaccelerate this year ? How do you think about I guess beyond 1Q and the benefits of rates ?Great . Could you say with that what the average maturity of your corporate loan book is or across the loan book in general ?Couple of questions . First , Citi is unique in the sense that the company has a global retail franchise or somewhat less global nowadays then you used to and each market is different . How are your deposit betas internationally compared to the U .S . market and what’s driving the fact there ?Okay , great . Thank you . And then switching gears to balance sheet trends . It seems like this year , you grew your cash and liquid assets at about 7%, which is faster than your loan growth at 3%. So given now we have more clarity with the tax reform , do you think maybe for 2018 and beyond , we might see – you might see loan growth exceeding your liquid asset growth ?Got it . And my follow-up question is on the consumer loan side , it was up $1.7B in a linked quarter basis . Two of your peers were relatively upbeat in terms of the consumer outlook for 2018 especially relative to tax reform and the question for you is , has the attrition in the consumer book bottomed in 2017? And on the mortgage side , as we think about non-conforming loan growth and loan originations , is there still a gap between what your underwriting standards are today and what you think they could go down to if we had better guidance or reform guidance from the agencies on mortgage ? Back to the loan growth front , thanks for the color on the areas you’ve commented on already . I know you’re seeing some of the attrition still in auto and declines in home equity , and you’re being selective in CRE . So , given that , as you look at 2018, can we see growth in 2018 in average loans vs . full year 2017? And is it commercial that can really drive that growth despite the headwinds ?Okay . And then the second question is just on liquidity . I know there was a couple of questions already on that . But I think if I heard you correctly , if loan growth accelerates beyond what we’re generating today , yourexpectation is that you might need to reset deposit rates . Did I hear you right on that ?Do you mind giving us your view on your situation ? I just raise the question because your LDR looks like it’s around 73% or 74%, so it seems like there might be room to… Okay , that’s helpful . And secondly , on , John , your comments on deposit betas and the possibility of maybe a nonlinear type of increase in deposit betas if you start to get loan growth , is there any way to – I know you’re probably going to say it’s difficult to put numbers around it , but I’ll ask anyway . If you were to see loan growth pick up and let’s just say loan growth picks up to mid-single digits , is there any way to think through the parameters about how much deposit betas can move up , maybe based on history or some assumptions of consumer behavior ? But is there any way to think about the parameters around which you might see deposit competition and deposit betas move up in that type of scenario ?I have a couple questions for you . Back , and this probably folds into the last question as well , for many years you were the lowest rate payer in the nation and you were able to maintain that through the location of branches , et cetera , et cetera . From a competitive standpoint and given the issues of the last couple of years , do you need to get into the middle of the pack or the top ? How do you feel competitively where you need to be positioned with deposit pricing in a rising rate environment ?So let\\'s talk deposit then . And where – as you talk about gathering more of your customers\\' wealth . Where is roughly your deposit penetration today and where should that be , where can it be based on ? I dont even know if we can say competitors\\' experience , because where you\\'re coming from in building the bank is a very different place from where others have come from ?Right . Got it . Okay . And then on that note separately , wanted to ask about loan growth or at least on your outlook; I know loans , at least for the quarter , were somewhat sluggish on an end-of-period basis , and it sounds like some of that may have been in the mortgage finance [indiscernible] (00:22:27), so want a little bit more color there , but separately , on the outlook , your mid-single digit outlook for 2018, I would have expected maybe it would be a little bit higher than the 2017 expectation , but it’s in line . It’s somewhat stable . So , why not see a strengthening in loan growth in 2018?So , in context of the progress on consumer loan growth , Bill , one of your peers said at an earlier conference call this morning mentioned that underwriting standards still remain a bit tight for a residential mortgage , and clearly , everybody is waiting for potential rule changes from the agencies , and I’m wondering – this is sort of a two-part question – if you could give us an update on the home lending transformation in terms of the origination prospects for this year and also sort of whether or not the expense base is now rightsized . And also , do you agree with the view that there is still some embedded conservatism in terms of underwriting standards for residential mortgage ?Yeah . Just a question on your excess liquidity . I was just curious if we can get an update on your thinking now that loan rates have backed up some here ?Very good . And I know , over the years , you guys have been an asset-sensitive bank , of course , and if we assume that this tax reform leads to stronger economic growth in 2018 and 2019, which would probably imply higher interest rates , how are you guys thinking about the balance sheet ? Are you keeping it the way it is or maybe making it more asset sensitive , less asset sensitive ?Within your guidance , you mentioned that you have three rate hikes combined with a slightly flattening yield curve given the outlook . Could you just give us a little bit of a color around does that assume that the yield curve stays where it is , where the [ph] two-tens spread (00:44:12) is just over 50BPS or are you seeing further flattening from where we are right now ?Right . And given shorter duration of your balance sheet and the outsized amount of liquidity compared to peers , you should benefit from the shorter end moving higher , right ?Okay . And then a follow-up on your comments regarding the system implementations and acceleration of consumer loan growth , you mentioned that you got the mortgage piece finalized on the new platform today and that the home equity and a few other products will follow up in 2018. It seems a couple of quarters later than normal . Was there a little bit of delay in the implementation of that ? And would that put a little bit of a headwind in your projections for consumer loan growth in 2018?I’d like to challenge you on one point that you made .And that is that you would bore us with the cost of capital discussion .Conceptually , it kind of makes sense . Again , it’s not boring . We’re a bunch of bank analysts . It’s interesting though .But let’s take that further as far as the impact of the lower taxes on corporate credit , and it seems like you could be guiding for a faster loan growth than you are . Do you expect this change to increase corporate loan growth ? Do you expect the CapEx cycle to change because of the tax change ? Are you budgeting more people or resources for that demand or do you think it’s going to be kind of a yawn ?My question is in two parts . The first is on the widening of the LIBOR-OIS basis recently . Are seeing any impact on your business and on your funding ability going forward ?Maybe talking about the deposits and managing it , I believe Tim and John talked about it on the call that , I think , you\\'ve identified maybe a couple hundred billion dollars of non-operational commercial deposits as the potential as maybe being able to move some of them . Can you share with us some of the thoughts of how you guys will be able to manage that ?Just circling back to your comments on the deposits and have you identified the non-operational and the financial institution deposits . Physically , how do you get them to leave ? Do you just lower the rate or do you physically talk to them and explain the situation and the customers move their deposits ? But how does that actually happen to move the amount ?Okay . Fair enough . So , in the presentation that came out , U .S . made it a $300 million to $400 million earnings impact directly related to optimizing the balance sheet to comply with the asset cap and then some cushion . So , one week later , any update to the estimated cost , the speed of the balance sheet shrink ? How quickly can you actually affect this and you had given three pillars , three different options to how the shrink was going to be affected . Any further thoughts on how this gets done ? Isn\\'t it good that you have CFO will experience , so ?Okay . And in terms of the timing and the pace of the shrink , do we see this happen quickly ? And this week you\\'re down $10 billion , or how does this happen ?Okay , great . LatAm was the one area that\\'s down . And it seems like an ongoing trend that there\\'s less loan activity there for you . Should I read something into that ?Got it . Thanks for the robust comprehensive answer . And then , lastly , it seems like your loan growth has been outgrowing your deposit growth at least on a year-over-year basis . So this is – if this continues for a while , would that be kind of a good way to run down some of your excess liquidity or will there be a time eventually where maybe you might need to raise some debt to kind of fund that gap if this continues , of course ?Question just on LIBOR and the three-month , one-month base differential that happened this quarter . How did that impact you guys in the NIM ?Right . And then front-end skew of your rate sensitivity , I mean , that is LIBOR-based and prime-based , I\\'m assuming both , but it\\'s just the bases that changed in the quarter didn\\'t impact you . Is that correct ?So , then when I look at the core accrual NIM , the one on page 10, the 3.54% this quarter , is that – we can build off of that for the rest of the year , given the forward curve is looking for a couple of more rate hikes .Okay . And then a separate question and [ph] I think this one (1:13:46) concerns about deposit costs and whether going from here – your deposit costs were up 8 basis points quarter-on-quarter . But are you seeing something different in the market over the last month or two that makes you concerned as well that there\\'s a more meaningful inflection in deposit costs ? Are you starting to see irrational pricing in the market , perhaps , or deposits moving faster , deposit gammas , I guess , going up or something else in the market that we\\'re not seeing in the numbers that you reported ?Was the deposit beta this quarter below to what you\\'re expecting ?Okay . Great . And then also on the credit cards , it looks like you\\'re getting solid card growth now with balances up 5% year-over-year . Is that some acceleration in new products that you\\'ve rolled outwithin the last year or so ? And do you think that growth can continue on the credit card front ? Andthen just as an add-on in terms of the seasoning , Paul , do you have any kind of view of what the paceof that 3% charge-off would look like as it seasons ? Thanks .Good morning . Maybe just a quick question on deposit pricing . You guys have been here in the retail side have kept deposit pricing quite low . Obviously , you\\'ve done a great job in focusing on small balances , transaction and relationship-type accounts . When do you think that pressure starts to build in your business ? Or is it because they\\'re transaction you just dont think there\\'s a lot of pressure for repricing retail deposits right now ?Right . And you\\'re still getting good growth , so it\\'s a good thing . Has the – if you look at the short-endof the curve your rate sensitivity numbers at the short-end really dont seem to have changed over thepast year despite multiple rate hikes . Is that sort of reflective of that experience of the type of depositsyou\\'re attracting are lower rate than maybe you initially thought and you have a little bit moresensitivity at the short-end even after the number of rate hikes we\\'ve seen ?Hi . I guess I have a good news-bad news question . The bad news for you , Brian , you know , the tax cut was supposed to lead to a lot for loan growth , the higher rates were supposed to lead to much higher margins , volatility was expected to lead to much higher trading not from your guidance , but just generally in the market , and as we sit here , it\\'s been a good meal , but where is the dessert ? So I guess the question there is should we expect more of a benefit from that in the future ? And if not , why , or how long does it take ?And then the good news is even without the dessert , so to speak , you guys still had some very nice efficiency , so if you could elaborate more on the record consumer efficiency and tie that more to the 1.4 billion quarterly hits you had in digital banking , like how much of the consumer efficiency is due to digital versus , say , branch closures or other actions . Where do you think that can go ?I was wondering where – if you could talk a little bit about the structure of the balance sheet and notice that you did have a lot of this cash come in , a lot of balances in lower yielding parts of the balance sheet and you also had a smaller securities portfolio , both a period-end and average . Can you talk about how much of that was just episodic or if it was a purposeful change , given the movement to the yield curve and how you might think about that kind of mix of the lower-yielding assets and mix going forward . Thanks .Yeah , no , that\\'s exactly it because it obviously had a huge balance-sheet growth , but the NIM was flat and it was largely just because of this mix . So I\\'m just wondering how much of that mix might naturally revert back out . You dont see as much balance-sheet growth , but you see the NIM start to move through .Yes . That\\'s exactly the point . Great . And then if I could follow-up just on the commercial lending front . You guys would also seem to be among the best position to see the small business middle market commercial uptick . Can you just talk about end demand and the tone you\\'re hearing and when and if are we going to see that translation into balance ? Because I heard your intro comments said things are good underneath . But just if you can flavor it by the product segment that\\'d be great . Thanks .Thank you . And as a follow up , Paul , you talked a little bit about the Commercial Real Estate loan portfolio growing , you\\'re more cautious . Some of the banks that have reported results have indicated that some of the underwriting in Commercial Real Estate is getting too aggressive . Can you give us more color ? Are you seeing that as well ? And how are you being more cautious in your underwriting ?Just a follow-up on the NIM . You\\'d mentioned the drags on a year-over-year basis from the card sale , and the markets impact was 12 basis points . I dont know if I missed what the 2Q swing was from the markets ?Combined the 100 million lower TEA and the markets impact is a couple basis points combined ?Okay . And then just separately . Deposits overall continue to grow , but we saw some decline in the noninterest-bearing bucket . And I think versus 4Q there\\'s some seasonality but obviously was also down year-over-year . I\\'m just wondering what your thoughts are in terms of how much further pressure there might be in that category ? And which business segment I think is probably if not on the Consumer side , it sounds like , but which segment that\\'s coming from ?Okay . And I guess is that factored , in the rate sensitivity that , as you\\'ve disclosed for the erosionThanks . Two questions . First , Paul , since you\\'re getting the mark-to-market in your equity already , is there some thought that periodically , you\\'ll go in and refresh the yields to get the benefit in the income statement while you\\'re already taking the hit on the equity side ?No , I understand . I kind of – maybe I didn\\'t do the question right . I\\'m thinking you can take actions because you\\'re forced to already recognize the loss on the AFS portfolio . You might as well go ahead and restructure , be able to buy new bonds , even you\\'re buying the same duration because you can generally add – I just did the math – somewhere between $0.15 and $0.20 just by going in and rounding up the yields when you\\'re already taking the hit on the equity side .Just had a quick question on the Commercial . You said you were able to grow C&I around 4% and 5%. Is there any way to break that down between just overall growth among existing customers ? Or is this what you\\'re getting from entrance into new markets ? Trying to get a sense of how much further you could go just by entering new markets and can continue to push C&I growth more ?Yeah , I know . I think you\\'ve done an unbelievably good job and a phenomenal job I would argue in terms of turning this company around . But I\\'m just wondering , because I\\'m going back two years , I\\'m not just looking at one quarter , and I\\'m seeing that common equity just doesn\\'t grow , and at some point , given the fact that assets do grow , that market capitalization does grow , that common equity is going to have to grow , and I dont know when that is .But the second question is we\\'ve seen , again , looking longer-term going back to the fourth quarter of2015 something like a 160 basis point , 165 basis point increase in the overnight rate , and the netinterest margin of the bank is up 25 basis points . The Fed funds rate is up , what , something like , Idont know , 80 basis points in the last year , and the net interest margin is unchanged .Now I know there\\'s a lot of dynamics; mix of business , the whole shape of the yield curve , shape ofthe balance sheet , et cetera , but when does the net interest margin of this bank start to reflect theOkay . Secondly , on the growth , the underlying growth issue , I think you said the underlying loan growth was 5%, but the reported growth was 3% due to the run-off of these noncore portfolios . Has there been any thought about sort of accelerating the disposition of these portfolios so that the underlying growth becomes more apparent ? I mean , would it take a capital hit at this point ? Or are there not buyers ? Or do you think it\\'s just better to work these things out over time ?Wanted to ask about LIBOR – we saw a big increase this quarter . Can you remind us how LIBOR affects you , kind of pros and cons ? Where do you have LIBOR sensitivity on the asset side ? And where do you have it on the funding-cost sensitivity to LIBOR ? And how should we think net-net about that ?And then , a follow-up on that . So , is this money sticky or not and if you could elaborate more on the deposit beta ? I know you’ve been pretty cautious saying that money could flee more easily , because if it’s digital , it goes . On the other hand , does it become more sticky because you have these connections ?Right . Okay . Thanks . And then , maybe just following up on asset yields , you saw overall asset yields jump pretty nicely given the higher rate environment , but securities portfolio yields were down . Is that sort of a shortening duration or just a mix issue ? Shouldn’t we expect securities yields to be moving higher in this environment ?Okay . And I apologize if you addressed this , I had to jump off the call for a minute . The deposit beta , where does it stand today for you folks ? And on Investor Day , you gave us a very good trajectory of where you think it’s going to . Are you still on that trajectory of where you think you should be ?So wanted to just start off with a question on the balance sheet growth . I was hoping you can give ussome better insight just in terms of the specific drivers of the balance sheet expansion . I recognize it wasa reflection of a pickup in client activity in the quarter . I just wanted to get a better sense as to what ,given the uptick in VaR as well as the sheer magnitude of balance sheet growth , why we didn\\'t see aI just wanted to ask another question here on the lending and such . Jon , you highlighted that the institutional lending supported – or lent some support to FICC trading results here this quarter . We certainly saw strong growth in the institutional balances here . Is some of this funding that you’re doing for CDs being used to fund some of the institutional loan growth ? What’s the plan for how long that would stay on the balance sheet ? And does this provide a pipeline for some DCM activity here over the coming quarters ?Terrific . So the follow-up would be then I’d expect that at least – while certainly volatility supported some of the trading strength here this quarter , there’s also some annuitized component to some of the revenue strength here in trading that sits on the balance sheet . And another component which you might not have touched upon , so I want to try and get at it a different way , is the CDs being used to fund this ? And are those deposit costs being borne in the NII one and Wealth , but not necessarily getting the benefit of the NII , and so it’s just a geography issue ? So we all might focus on the Wealth NII , but you really are generating the economics , it’s just not flowing through that line . Thanks .Got it . Okay , all right . And then , my follow-up is around loan growth . I know you did not change your fullyear outlook around loan growth . The average balances were somewhat flattish this quarter . You did seegood growth in the end of period . So first of all , I\\'m assuming the end-of-period trends are likely moreindicative of your expectations given you\\'re not changing your full year outlook . And then separately , canyou talk about the broader macro backdrop ? I mean , we\\'ve seen weak industry loan growth , that\\'s forsure , for the sector . But the macro signs still point to improvement , particularly given tax reform . So if youOkay . And then separately , just -- I wanted to drill a little bit down on C&I . I know that you went throughthe various categories and where you\\'re seeing the loan growth . It does feel like it\\'s decelerating a littlebit . I mean , year-on-year , it\\'s clearly stronger than what the LQA would be . But the question is , are youable to deliver the level of growth you\\'ve been generating , which looks like it\\'s not only solid good , butmaybe a little above peers , due to the new markets you\\'re going into ? Or is there any sign of increasedinterest in current borrowers actually increasing their leverage and borrowing more ? Do you see more ofthe share gain or clients are increasing their activity levels that you already have ?So a little bit of a pickup though from what you\\'ve had this quarter in terms of run rate there ?In regards to the loan growth , just a follow-up there , does the retail digital strategy and the rollout of thathave a big impact on your expected loan growth at the back half of this year ?Okay . And so where would you think that securitization activity will probably normalize in the secondquarter ? So maybe that could offset a little bit of the core growth you guys are seeing in your otherHi . Saul Martinez , UBS . You showed an interesting slide showing attrition rates coming down in recent years , churn rates coming down to your customers . It seems like that\\'s sort of\\xa0an industry trend though over the last few years . I guess – and I think it dovetails with what we said earlier about the importance of convenience technology , all those things to maintain every time clients . But do you , I guess the question is , do you do you agree with that ? Do you – and what does it mean , do you think that will continue also as if interest rates rise will we see greater churn rate ? And do you think it has implications for deposit pricing and deposit competitions , as does it mean that in this cycle or does that suggest then this cycle maybe deposit competition and deposit betas won\\'t be as pronounced as in the past , because these other factors are enhancing the stickiness of your customer base ?Thank you . Gerard Cassidy , RBC Capital Markets . Two questions; first one is quick . I think you said you opened up 19% of your deposit accounts online . Do you have a target of where you think that may get to in two or\\xa0three years ?Thank you . Gerard Cassidy , RBC Capital Markets . Perry , you mentioned that you guys know the commercial real estate market is probably better than anyone here in the U .S . Can you guys give us your outlook on what\\xa0parts of the country might be showing some weakness , what type of property types are you seeing that might also be weak and also the strengths , where are you seeing some real strength in the commercial real estate market ?Yeah . Chris Kotowski from Oppenheimer . Earlier this morning , Mary Mack kind of evidenced extraordinary caution on the Auto sector and showed how you cut your originations in auto loans in half . And I\\'m wondering is that paralleled by a concern on the Wholesale side about the whole food chain dealers , suppliers , producers and so on .And Mary , I\\'ve got two questions for you . One is when you look at mortgage , you look at your slide , you have the slide that was up there that had the composition of originations . You can tell how that business has changed .\\xa0Several of your peers [ph] dont even going to start not reporting anything on mortgage anymore , they just gone away . I dont want are we in the business or are we not in the business , but really , how do you visualize that business is just different , it\\'s going to be different as we go forward than what we used to have prior the residential kind of downfall that we had in ?Thank you . John Pancari , Evercore ISI . Coming to revenue growth question another way , can you talk about how you think about loan growth ? I mean clearly there is pressure this year , but it\\'s – we\\'re seeing the pressure\\xa0while some of your direct competitors , the MoneyCenter players are growing a lot faster . And so , you can attribute some of it to the market , but not so much . So , can you just give us an idea of what are the real , where do you see upside to loan growth and because clearly you said it can\\'t really the asset cap , you have room in the balance sheet to allow loans to still grow . So , what made your businesses do you think can really drive that upside and closing the gap to some of your competitors ?Tim , couple of questions , just a follow-up on that question that you were just responding to . So in January , you gave us this expectation of what you thought would happen with this asset freeze from the fed and you said\\xa0loan and deposit growth has been less than expected . Obviously , some other things you pointed out like auto , et cetera , you\\'ve already put that in place , because you were already on that path to cut back your risk . So , where has the shortfall come on the loan side ? Can you talk about that ? That\\'s my first one . And then I have a follow-up for John .So in – the slide which says that reduction in the balance sheet , you didn\\'t have to do much because things have been slower , softer than you had expected when you talked about the – you did the call post the asset freeze . Where have we seen a shortfall , maybe John ?Hey , thanks . Two questions . One , just on rates , obviously rates have risen a bit here over the last year and a half or so . Can you speak to any parts of your loan book where you see your customers you know maybe being\\xa0impacted by that . Is there any sign at all anywhere that higher rates matter to borrower ability to repay their loans ?You\\'ve seen the big banks gain national deposit share , partly with technology , partly some of the expansions . And we saw this happen with consolidation in the credit card business , mortgage lending , do you see the deposit business becoming a national business ?Can you talk a little bit about the lending environment ? Where are you seeing opportunities to grow loans and any areas where you think competition is getting a little bit out of hand ?And on the loan volume side , still opportunity to grow there . I mean , the securities-based lending , I think there\\'s kind of concern that eventually that gets tapped out . Mortgage has been an [ph] effort (26:57), obviously rate\\'s gone up a little bit . How are you thinking about the lending outlook here ?Just a follow-up question on the NII . What\\'s your kind of outlook on the deposit beta , as we have further rate hikes ?Yeah . And maybe just one on regulation in terms of the DOL , the conflicts of interest , where are we and where are we going ?And in terms of excess liquidity , do you feel like you have a fair amount now relative to what you need for regulatory purposes , or it\\'s just a question of the pricing and rates available that dictates how much you put to work ?Okay . And on the loan growth side , the two areas that you\\'re really experiencing runoff . Auto , it sounds like you might have pushed out the timeframe for that to start growing till mid-next year . But do you expect the pace of its decline to slow so you\\'re not losing $2 billion a quarter or [ph] seem to (32:30) decline ? And then also on home equity , should that pace start slowing ?Good morning , guys . Hey , appreciate the commentary on sort of the movements within the loan portfolio . I guess just as you guys see it , I know there\\'s at least some concern that balances are just sort of leaving , to a certain extent , involuntarily . But I guess as you guys see it , you\\'ve been pretty clear on whether CRE or auto , those intentional runoffs , on an aggregate basis , how do you see the runoff being sort of conscious versus involuntary as you guys look at things from the inside ?Yeah . Switching gears , a quick question on the C&I . Is there a way you can break down kind of how you\\'re seeing borrower demand by maybe the different groupings , by large corporate , middle market , small business ? Are you seeing any pick-up in demand in one of those segments offset by somewhere else ? And also , touch on how most of the growth this quarter was in foreign , what was going on with the foreign growth .Hi , guys . John , you guys obviously had a nice increase in the net interest margin in the quarter , and I think you mentioned that one of the benefits was the less negative impact of the hedge ineffectiveness . Can you quantify for us how many basis points that was of the increase ?Okay . And going forward , should that continue to be incrementally growing or is it now just baked in and it shouldn\\'t really have an impact going forward ?I see . And , Tim , in one of your answers you talked about historically wells has seen the commercial real estate competition or headwinds . Can you give us a little more color of what you\\'re seeing today , whether it\\'s lower yields on loans or underwriting standards or actually weakening where loan to values are higher ? And how does it compare at this point in the cycle to your memory of past cycles ?Yeah , and that\\'s – my follow up was going to be along those lines , which is as you continue to work on efficiency of the balance sheet , are there still a bunch of those either lower quality or non-quality deposits that you continue to kind of move out ? Or is that now kind of – we\\'ve seen this big decline in the foreign offices , obviously , and a couple other areas , so how close are you to [indiscernible] (01:10:23) that max efficiency ?Good morning . So a couple from me . One , looking back at last quarter , one of the things I liked at least about the quarter was the spike in the balance sheet and we didn\\'t really see a follow-through into this quarter . Can you talk a little bit about what you\\'re seeing as far as client demand for your balance sheet and kind of what your outlook is there ?That\\'s probably a good segue into net interest income . You did some repositioning of the swap portfolio that causes a little bit of pain near term , but sets you up better for rising interest rates . So , talk about that and kind of what drove the motivation to reposition that as you think about how much more rates may go up where we are in this cycle .And it was the best scenario is probably parallel move up in rates , but in terms of leverage to the short end versus the long end , what\\'s the mix of that at this point ?And specifically on the net interest margin percent , the swaps is only one piece , the leverage to rates is obviously one piece . Loan growth which we\\'ll get into in a minute here is an important component . But when you take it all together , what do you think is the trajectory for the NIM from here ? I think you\\'ve had certainly less upside than some peers . Some of it was the swaps . Some of it is probably loan runoff . But where are we in terms of , in aggregate , those drags going away and maybe seeing some progression [indiscernible] (23:02)?And how is loan demand shaping up ? We\\'ve had some chatter about commercial loan growth picking up a little bit . I\\'m not sure everyone is really seeing that or that it\\'s really been that robust . What are you seeing in terms of loan demand ?And how about the pace of consumer loan growth , have you seen any change there ? I mean , I think the initial benefit of tax reform , there was thought that maybe it would suppress growth in the first quarter . There\\'s obviously a seasonality from a low seasonality perspective in 1Q . But if you adjust for all that , do you feel like you\\'re seeing any change in the pace of consumer [ph] growth (26:53)?So the group basically had 2 key drivers that we\\'re looking for . One is loan growth . One is expensemanagement , operating leverage . I think you hit on both of those . But maybe we can just dig in a little bitAnd you said a couple of times , \"Look , we\\'re going to stay in our credit box .\" Question one is , do you feellike you\\'re maxing out your loan growth that you\\'re capable of within the credit box you have today ? Andtherefore , is there a need to maybe widen a little bit to accelerate growth ? Some color on that .Okay . Where do you feel that the opportunity set is the biggest ?And just when you\\'re talking about loan growth , do you see the biggest bang for your buck coming outof digital ? Or is it really that direct either via call center or chat bot or just good old-fashioned Q&A in aIn ICG Corporate Lending , the rev is up 22% as you pointed out . I’m curious the combination of , A , biggest drivers of that loan growth and if you think that actually improves as all the tax regime filters through; and B , the other part of your comment would help that was lower hedging cost . And I thought that was a little curious in a world where rates are rising , so one mathematical and one more related to growth .I had a little more recent question , but just on the NII uptick and strengthened NIM this quarter . Could you just give us a sense as to… So , you had a nice pickup , right , in NIM this quarter ......first time in a while . So just wanted to get a sense as to why we should expect that , that’s going to be sustainable . And in particular , can you speak a little bit to the NII lift that you had in the institutional segment as well ? Because it was obviously 2% year-on-year , but 12% Q-on-Q . So , wanted to understand what’s going on there .One more balance sheet question , John . Just deposits are growing really well for you guys and the beta is obviously picking up too , especially sequentially . It’s\\xa0hard to see some of the detail when we think about the averages .So can you walk us through just how U .S . rate curves vs . non-U .S . rate curves are affecting how you’re looking at deposit growth and what you’re paying in different markets ? And is this the type of improvement that we should start seeing in terms of incremental betas from here ?Hey , good afternoon . I just have two quick questions . One , on the Corporate/Other , you mentioned there\\'s going to be one to 150 over the remainder of 2018, but is the expectation then that it kind of tracks lower from there as anything improves from there as the legacy assets roll off into 2019 and 2020?Right , but on the revenue side , what\\'s tracking below ? Is it just loan growth is weaker than expected ? Is it ...?Wanted to ask a little bit about the rates and the curve , the bank stocks have really been weighed down by the flattening 2-year to 10-year , investors are focused on that . This quarter we saw you benefit from higher short rates and you put cash to work kind of in the mid to longer end . So , kind of wondering where is the curve relevant for you , and where is it not relevant ? Kind of , how you think about this kind of curve debate that’s happening relative to your fundamentals ?Question on – just as we’re thinking NIM outlook and trajectory , I know we talked about the deposit beta side and asset yields , et cetera , but could you give us a little color on how you’re thinking about the non-deposit funding , and is there any type of mix shift we could see you do there over time ? Is there any kind of restructuring that you might consider ? Because those cost of funds came down quite a bit in the past couple of quarters and maybe there’s an opportunity there to restructure that and slow the uptick in cost of funds on that side of the balance sheet .And like just the mix between sub-debt or senior debt or FHLB or other borrowed , there’s no need to mix it up at all ?On the securities portfolio , noticed that obviously you had a – put a lot of the liquidity to work . I wanted to ask you , 2.91% average yield , what are you finding , what are your new money yields coming on at ? And how much more remix into securities and out of cash do you still have the ability to do especially with a still quite attractive loan to deposit ratio ? Thanks .You have may have mentioned that the consumer – I mean , deposit betas are expected to accelerate through the rest of this year . Even though they’ve accelerated quite a bit here in Q2 from Q1 up to 40% for the consumer betas .Is that catch-up in the back half of the year ? And do you expect it to go above 50% as we move through H2?And then given the outlook for rates in the back half of this year and given your revenue guidance , it implies that you probably have quite a bit of acceleration in loan growth combined with a little bit of expansion in NIM . Are you assuming that deposit betas and borrowing funds continue to grow , or at least move higher at the same rate that we saw in H1 this year ?I want to follow-up a little bit on the deposit side , not the beta question , but on just overall balances and looking at the end-of-period spot balances . So , it looks like the DDA balances have been declining since Q3 2016 roughly , a little over $82B at the end of Q3 2016, now at $79B , and then down about 1% y-over-y . So , are you seeing commercial companies shifting into – to try to get some rate ? And then , I guess , is there conversation with those customers about earnings credit or some of those deposits actually going out of the system and being used ?And then , do you have the mix ? The interest-bearing deposit growth kind of helped to move total deposit growth . Can you give the mix of how much of that is in CDs vs . the money market accounts ?And then separately , your borrowing costs are up meaningfully again this quarter , presumably on the widening 90-day LIBOR spread on an average basis . That said that spread has come in a bit more recently . Given that , should we expect that to be benefit in Q3 or have you guys started to swap that out at all ? I know you may have mentioned that on the last call .Looking at the trading action in your stock and most of the other banks , it seems to me everyone is concerned about the rising deposit betas and the flattening yield curve . But I guess when I stand back and look at it big picture I see 2.9% y-over-y loan growth and 6.9% net interest income growth . And so , clearly , you’re still getting a very significant benefit and I assume most of that is coming from the three funds – demand deposits , equity , and other float . And I guess , what needs to – when does a further Fed rate increase not become a benefit ? I mean it just seems to me you’d have to have an extreme view of deposit betas or curve in order for further Fed hikes not to have a beneficial impact for you .I mean just , it’s still a benefit , right ? It’s all still ...The thing is it seems to me most bank kind of business models were kind of calibrated in an environment when short rates were like between 3% and 6%. I mean that was kind of historically the normal range and we’re still below that . I mean , would you say that ...Want to ask you about the loan growth . Given the competition that we’re seeing in pricing and maybe some underwriting loosening , are you really kind of keeping the PNC legacy in this part of the cycle when you start to see that growing half of what the market’s growing is probably the right position to be in ?I got two questions for you . If you looked at where the yield curve kind of lays out right now , the flatness between the 2-year and 10-year but yet still a big kind of cliff down to the short rates , that steepness of the curve you get all the benefits from going from one day or one month to one or two years . You don’t have to take much duration and you get all the benefit , is that part of why you began to deploy some of that liquidity ? Because really it almost becomes a no-brainer to create something with that much cash flow that shorter duration and get that much benefit . And then lastly , when do mortgage fees start to work again ? I mean , we watch this whole cycle waiting on that business to kind of kick in and we just haven’t got it yet .You\\xa0have\\xa0notched\\xa0up\\xa0a\\xa0little\\xa0bit\\xa0maybe\\xa0on\\xa0lines\\xa0drawing\\xa0down\\xa0interest\\xa0activity ?The net interest margin percent didn\\'t move as much in the first quarter . You\\'ve been using some of the balance sheet in the Capital Markets business . Maybe just explain that a little bit more .So let me just follow-up , if I might , on Glenn’s question about the deposits . So , your deposits for the institution areup about $12B or so , linked-quarter about 8%. We didn’t see quite that much growth in lending . I think lendingand commitment – the balancing lending and commitment is up about $8B , and so , really $4B on the balancesheet . You’re talking about the sweeps adding another $10B probably , as you implement the next phase in Q3.Just help us think a little bit from a very big picture point of view , how you’re thinking about deploying depositfunding , despite the fact that it’s clearly getting more expensive ?Just quickly , on the sweep changes that you’ve made to the deposit program , so I guess $20B , $10B from lastquarter and $10B going forward . Is that it or is there more that you think you can generate after that ?Marianne , I wanted to ask you what you\\'re seeing this quarter in terms of Consumer deposit trends , alittle more color on both the pricing beta and volume balances . Kind of wondering if you\\'re seeing a lot ofcompetition from the online competitors like Marcus and whether those are affecting your deposit balanceswith consumers being attracted to those high yields . And are they affecting your pricing decisions ?Maybe just talk a little bit about loan growth . Obviously , it seems to have picked up in the Fed data overthe last month or 2. What are you guys seeing on the ground ? And do you think what we\\'ve seen so far isa good indicator for maybe a more sustained pickup in growth ?Okay . And maybe as a follow-up , when we think about NIM going forward -- I mean , I think it was acouple of years ago that you\\'ve talked about maybe normalized being somewhere in the 2.65% to 2.75%range or 2.46% now . Is there a certain loan-to-deposit ratio you think you need to have or level of rate ?How do we -- just trying to think through how we think about NIM going forward .Just one follow-up on the competition conversation . I just want to see -- your loan growth decelerated , butit was in line with your 7% to 8% goal , your loan beta capture . What you\\'re getting on the pricing side isactually a little bit better than what you\\'ve given up on the deposit side . So that all seems fine , but this isthe first time I remember putting that comment about the competition . Are you still okay with the 7% to8% goal ? And maybe just an add-on to that . I\\'m just curious if part of the competition has anything to dowith the private credit market . That seems to be growing pretty strongly .Marianne , can you share with us -- and correct me if I\\'m wrong , I think you guys have given us somecolor in the past about the impact of the Fed taking down their balance sheet over the next 3 to 5 yearsby a couple of trillion dollars , that it will impact your deposit side of the balance sheet . Can you give us anOkay . And then as a follow-up , I know you\\'ve touched on this increased competition . Can you give usmaybe some more details , in the Commercial Real Estate and the residential mortgage area , what you\\'reactually seeing ? Is it just pricing ? Or is it now loan covenants ? Is it loan to values ? Any further color there ?Let me start with my first question . So Citi Capital XIII has $2.2B outstanding at LIBOR plus 637BPS and is permanently grandfathered as a T1, as I understand . And you have talked about this in the past , but maybe if you could , update us on the latest plan for this security . Okay . So at some point if it becomes economically attractive , do you look at it ? Do you think that makes sense to maybe take it out or redeem ? If it’s already getting the capital treatment , does economics matter in the longer term ?Great , thank you . The third question is around Fed balance sheet unwind . So how will Citi cope with the balance sheet unwind in the fall when the pace accelerates to $50B per month ? Regardless of LCRs , how will the system in aggregate deal with this and be able to grow balance sheet while deposits are potentially pressured ?Just in terms of looking at the HQLA balances for Citi , it looks like you vs . some peers have a higher concentration of other Level 1A assets . Is there some reason for that , that you have compelling reason to hold Level 1 excess reserves ? And how do you think about the – kind of the interplay between those two levels ?Great . Thank you . Just the last question I have , in terms of the securities portfolio , with the hike on the higher front-end rates vs . ILAR , how are you thinking about duration within the securities portfolio ? Are you adding it ? Are you subtracting from it , or are you kind of waiting for loan growth to pick up ? Thank you .So most of our questions have been asked and answered , but I was wondering if you could touch on your deposit base , which is rather unique . And can you elaborate on deposit costs and beta trends outside of the U .S .?Great , thank you . And I was wondering if you could also elaborate on the reasons for issuing bank level debt compared to deposits ?A couple of questions . One on the curve and a couple on credit . First one , in the past we’ve talked about how you – how Citi makes money really on movements in the very , very front end of the curve , to characterize what you’ve said in the past . One of your competitors said that the short end of the curve in terms of movements represents about 70% of their sensitivity . Could you put a little flesh on the bone around Citi’s sensitivity ? How much of that – is it comparable to a 70% number ?Okay . So above a 70% number is a good number . Thanks .And then probably more of a John question around credit . First , when we look at credit extension over the past quarter or so , could you talk a little bit about line utilization and purpose ? And by this I mean domestically . Specifically what are you seeing in terms of utilization ? And is new lending going for M&A ? Is it going for CapEx ? Is it really fueling economic growth ? Or is it just refinancing what’s already out there ?Most of my questions have been asked and answered . Just wanted to follow up on the earlier caller’s question about deposit betas outside the U .S . Competitors have commented that betas within the U .S . have been below expectations . I think you had mentioned the deposit betas outside the U .S . have been in line with your expectations . Does that include anti-U .S . sentiment if that does exist ?Well , how about , is it something that you stress for ? You had mentioned you stress for almost everything under the sun .So irrespective of where the deposits may reside , it is mainly an analysis of change in rates and alternative opportunity sets ?Maybe just talk a little bit about loan growth , what you\\'re saying ? Obviously , the H .8 data has beenshowing signs of life . Are you seeing that as well ? And how do you think about that going forward in termsGreat . So you are not seeing any real acceleration yet ?Couple of questions . One is on just deposit betas and getting a little bit more color there . I know youmentioned in the prepared remarks , the overall deposit beta . Can you give us a sense as to whereyou think you are in the commercial , the wealth , the consumer buckets ? I\\'m just trying to get anunderstanding of which buckets are higher than others ? And do you see an acceleration in any of theseOkay . And you spoke to the noninterest bearing on the consumer side growing nicely . What about on thecommercial side ? Are you seeing a shift from NIB to fees ? Or are you holding your NIB in the commercialYes . Okay , but I guess part of the point you\\'re making is that that\\'s in the run rate already .And the checking accounts that you\\'re growing on the consumer side , do you see that more in your branchexpansion areas ? Or is that more in your legacy , for a lack of a better word , legacy footprint ?And do you have any need to refinance ? Or is that a net of any incremental funding to -- as a swap ? Or isthis a -- is it going to be a net nice benefit ?That\\'s what I meant . Just the replacement financing for getting rid of the higher-cost TruPS ?Okay . And then also you mentioned the market impact on long-term debt . Did we see any of that 30-, 90-day disconnect still come through on average this quarter ? And do you expect that to get better as we goOkay . Because that was going to be my final question is just what can you do to arrest the increase toGlenn\\'s point before of those 3 bottom lines on the lower-right side of the liability side , which are movingYou said the average checking account sizes up . It\\'s gone from what to what ?Okay . So does that help keep the deposit betas lower for longer ? I guess , if you were to offer 1% less ininterest , so what are we talking about here , $75 a year ? And in terms of that $75, what -- someone mightgive up , they get all the mobile banking and online checking and everything else , is that how we shouldOn NII , Paul , obviously , part of the lack of clarity around the NII guide is in part due to the uncertaintyaround retail deposit beta and then on the consumer side where you haven\\'t seen much , if anything , interms of deposit rates moving up . But is there anything that gives you pause ? Is that -- we are nearinga tipping point . Any changes on the margin in consumer behavior ? Are you starting to see ? For example ,any migration or sense that there will be migration out of noninterest-bearing into higher-yieldinginstruments ? Just curious if there\\'s anything that gives you pause that maybe we will start to see depositcosts move up because it\\'s obviously not showing up in the numbers in any meaningful way just yet .Okay . No , that\\'s helpful . And if I could also just ask a follow-up question on the increase in funding costson the Fed funds . You mentioned -- can you clarify what you mean by settle in ? Is that -- should weinterpret that as kind of remaining at the current 2.15%? Or is that to suggest that there should be somesort of normalization in 3Q and a bit of a tick down in the funding cost line there ?Got it . So it\\'s trading-related NII . But what we\\'re looking as Page 9 in the supplement . It\\'s -- the costwent to $1,462 million versus $1,135 million , and it\\'s a sequential increase of about 49 basis points , but itsounds like it\\'s related to kind of the Global Markets side as you said . Okay .Paul , wanted to ask you , everybody\\'s talking about the flatness of the yield curve . But if you look at the3 months to 2 year , talks about deploying a little bit of your cash . That\\'s a part of the yield curve thatactually is pretty advantageous . You dont have to go out with duration actually to pick up 80, 90 basispoints . So was that part of what you\\'re thinking was as you were kind of deploying some of that liquidity ?Okay , great . Yes , I just had a quick one , a lot of them have been already asked already . Is there a waythat you could size what the runoff portfolio did , quarter-on-quarter , so we can kind of get back to whatYes , it was in the loan book . You said you were still seeing some of the headwinds from the runoffportfolios coming down , but I didn\\'t hear dollar amounts around what size is now for the runoff portfolio ?Helpful . Earlier , you talked about net interest income kind of being above the range . We\\'ve heard others talk , complaining about LIBOR being lower than expected . We\\'ve heard others talk about the yield curve being flatter than anticipated . Obviously , with the Fed unwinding the balance sheet , deposit betas , I guess , were being lower than anticipated , helps you relative to your guidance . Can you talk in terms of your outlook in terms of managing the balance sheet in this kind of maybe flatter yield curve environment and an environment where , I think , expectations are that betas will ultimately rise .Interesting . You mentioned loan growth being an important factor . I know you guys have talked to 6% to 7% type core loan growth this year , which is good . I think – maybe delve more into kind of what your outlook for loan growth is . Certain banks , so far , in this conference , have kind of talked down near-term expectations , and really been talking down expectations for the last year and a half or so .I guess , why is your loan growth kind of above others ? You talked about taking share on the deposit side , also taking share on the lending side , and kind of where do you see kind of additional opportunities going forward ?...particularly with a lot of the demographics that you\\'re targeting with the Sapphire , both the Checking and the Sapphire Reserve . If you think about it , anyone aged maybe 18 to 35, let\\'s say , 40, hasn\\'t really been an adult and had a bank account in an environment where they had interest on any of their deposits . So , to what extent do you think customers will eventually expect some yields on their deposits , or is it just not even on the forefront of the minds of most people under a certain age ?The first question is , and we\\'re going to ask these for all the companies similar to what we did last year . But do you own the stock ? A , overweight; B , market weight; C , underweight or short; or D , no ? Some put downoverweight . Very – so , actually , 40% said overweight , which is up slightly from 38% last year .And maybe the next question . If you dont own the shares of Citi or underweight improvement , which one of these factors would most let you change your mind ? A , loan growth; B , margin; C , fee income; D , expenses , dividend ,buyback and valuation ? And interesting , loan growth and expenses ......are the two clear winners . I guess John , you definitely talked about expenses in your presentation , did a good job there . Maybe just expand upon loan growth in terms of what you\\'re seeing on both the consumer side as well as the wholesale side ?So , in the rising rate environment , do you see an increase in the liabilities , especially in the Consumer side of the bank ? Do you have a projection as the rates continue to rise ? How does that affect your balance sheet ?I mean , you have a large Consumer business .On liability management , I kind of heard what you said about trying to knock down the debt levels and sort of smooth the maturities out over time . But is there a point at which kind of deposit liabilities become more of a concern ? And I mean if everybody just depends on the deposit liabilities as their source of funding , I mean there was a time when banks were really hurt by relying â?? over-relying on deposits . I mean is that â?? at what point do you feel that that becomes an issue we have to start match funding a little bit better ?  Yeah , you got to wait and hear about it from the Fed . Yeah . Just under half year revenue , net interest income seems to have stabilized at around $10.5 billion a quarter , but it\\'s hard to break out of that range , What\\'s needed to kind of get the NII to grow ? Yeah . So there\\'s not much more until the debt pay down , until maybe some of the price of debt comes down a little bit more . And how do you expect your deposit franchise to behave when rates rise and what do you think the advantages are that BofA has in terms of re-pricing and holding on to deposits if some flee the system ? And are you seeing revolve start to increase ? You mentioned that you think the balances might start to grow . That\\'s just because of the new accounts you have or you\\'re starting to see some revolve ? Ultimately , you said something in the $500 million [indiscernible] (29:22). Yeah , you [indiscernible] (35:35) at 75% or so today , and you\\'re getting to get close in terms of expenses but you need some â?? to get to one , you need some help on the revenue . There\\'s a few questions about what if rates stay low . You kind of addressed that a little bit , but how much does it kind of dive into 10-year [indiscernible] (37:21) and what can you do if rates stay low for the next year or two ? So there are a couple of questions following up on the deposits and your strategy of kind of retaining them . So what do you think are the most important factor in terms of retaining deposits when rates rise and what advantages does BofA have there ? Not bad . I noticed on one of your first slides that long-term debt was down a bunch . Thatâ??s in line with I think your previous , so I was just curious on what your refinancing schedule thought process is for the next say six to twelve months . What do you need to fund , what donâ??t you ?  Bruce , how much did the loan rates hit the hedge component in Q2? How much did the hedging component hurt NII ? I know you mentioned that was a factor .  Okay , and you did use the term trough for the NIM and I guess NII too Could you give us your outlook in the near term about where you see the NIM and NII heading ?  And in NIM , Bruce , your answer there to summarize on the NIM percentage could bounce around either way give or take depending on what happens on liquidity ?  Maybe I donâ??t know if you could flesh out the answer a little more as to how you are confident that this quarter or Q3 are the trough in net interest income and what things would lead you to think that that number turns around and starts to grow .  Bruce , that $300mm you identified on the hedging , does that come back or is that just the absence of a negative in the future ?   Most of my questions were answered , but I have one specific question for Bruce . Itâ??s a bit detailed . If you look on page 10 of the supplement , which is the liability side of the average balance sheet , Iâ??m focused in on your cost of federal funds purchased , securities loaned or sold under agreements of repurchase . That cost this quarter was 159BPS , up from 129BPS last quarter and 79BPS a year ago .  And Iâ??m comparing that to other banks . I just compared that to JPMorgan , for example . Two questions for you . First on the Commercial Bank , I think you said that CRE declined by about $2.2B , and then you had some loan growth in middle market C&I . Has the middle market C&I loan growth continued as weâ??ve gone into Q3 here , and was the CRE runoff planned or unplanned ?  I guess the reason of my question is the companies that weâ??ve seen report thus far are reporting the glimmers of commercial beginning â?? commercial loan growth . And I just wanted to see if that was your experience as well or if you can just give us an overall view of whether weâ??re at a growth inflection point yet .  So Brian , let me kick-off with a couple of questions .  The first is , I appreciate that you\\'ve obviously got lot more capital , you got lot more reserves , the loan portfolios are a lot smaller . But on the surface , the assumptions that the Fed has given , especially for the stress scenario , do appear very stressful . And how do you think about what the loss rate could be , in some of your mortgage portfolios in particular , in the scenario where you\\'ve got a 20% decline in house prices and unemployment goes to 13%?  comes , youâ??ll see the details . Question â?? Glenn Schorr: Got it , okay . Maybe this is somewhat related . [inaudible] has a decent amount of debt coming due over the course of the next say 12 â?? 18 months , but you also have a cap on liquidity as the balance sheetâ??s come in a little bit . Can you just talk about your expectations on the funding side ? Answer â?? Kevin Stitt: Overall debt issuance ? Answer â?? Joe Price: Overall on debt issuance ? Question â?? Glenn Schorr: Yes , overall debt issuance , yes . Answer â?? Joe Price: As I mentioned before , given the liquidity base and given the asset side of the balance sheet , donâ??t expect us to replace maturities completely now . We need to stay active and we will stay active , and there are some attractiveness to the rate environment , et cetera , from that standpoint . But the way you should look at it is if you go back to my remarks , youâ??ll see we gave the actual numbers of whatâ??s coming due . Weâ??ll continue to let some of that drift down as opposed to full replacement . Question â?? Glenn Schorr: And then I donâ??t know if thereâ??s much you can say in the prepared remarks . You told us that the [inaudible] charge was a little higher , but there seems to be a mounting concern that those numbers start to add up . Is there any help that you can give us in terms of sizing the amount of claims against you from the various counterparties ? Answer â?? Joe Price: Obviously I donâ??t want to go into the details on specific clients or customers or insurers from that standpoint . But think of it as , and we have gone through this not recently but some of the earlier days right after the acquisition of Countrywide , there are several buckets . There are claims that come back from the GSEs . There are claims that come back from purchasers of loans; think of that as private transaction . And there are monoline wrap things . We continue to work each of those based on the claims that are presented . Iâ??d be disingenuous if I didnâ??t say people were throwing everything over the wall they can because they are in a view of trying to get something back . But look , this is a loan-by-loan detailed review of the facts and \\x0c    callstreet report  Bank of America Corp . BAC Q4 2009 Earnings Call Jan . 20, 2010 Companyâ?² Tickerâ?² Event Typeâ?² Dateâ?²         www .CallStreet .com  â?¢  212-849-4070 â?¢  Copyright Â© 2001-2010 CallStreet  17circumstances , whether itâ??s curable , whether the loan has been performing for an extended period , all the practices and those things , and we reserve for it on a FAS 5 basis . Think of it as quarterly we book in the hundreds of millions dollar number , which is I think Iâ??ve mentioned before netted against the production income . Weâ??ll continue to do that . But look , this is not a quick process . This is a multiyear extended process looking at individual credits . Question â?? Glenn Schorr: I appreciate that answer . As you go through it and as you start to have some experience on where replacements are needed vs . cases you win , does that give you a good enough window into the future to be boosting reserves other than what the current billing is ? In other words , you donâ??t disclose to us what the size of say the past originations and sales in question are or the reserves are . But people basically want to get a feel from you of whether or not you feel youâ??re well enough reserved or if this is going to be a persisting and mounting issue over the coming eight quarters . Answer â?? Joe Price: Look , I think the way to think about it is Countrywide had a reserve . We adjusted that in purchase accounting . Weâ??ve been adding to it quarterly or dealing with it quarterly with the expenses each quarter since then , and weâ??ll continue to manage it that way . Yes , we do get more experience every quarter as we go through the individual loans . Remember though that weâ??ve had some pretty tough consumer real estate portfolios that have been wrapped by insurers . We exited a business back in 2001 that we went through some of the same kind of exercises with . So the same team that has done that , those workouts , which I might add continue today from back then , and thatâ??s what I was talking about , the protracted nature of how this process works , or the ones on it . And so we do have quite a bit of experience in how to estimate on a FAS 5 basis . Iâ??d only characterize the reserve that we are carrying is in the billions , so we feel pretty good about where we stand . But look , weâ??ll continue to get claims and weâ??ll continue to work through it and it doesnâ??t go away overnight . Question â?? Glenn Schorr: Okay , thank you very much .   Analyst: Matthew Oâ??Connor: â?? Deutsche Bank Question â?? Matthew Oâ??Connor: Hi , guys . Answer â?? Joe Price: Hey , Matt . Answer â?? Brian Moynihan: Matt , how are you ? Question â?? Matthew Oâ??Connor: I guess first on the credit side , Joe , you provided a lot of comments regarding specific loan buckets . It seems like some are trending up still .to date . So I think from the polls , what we learned too is that , as I\\'m sure you all now , expenses are top of mind with people , as well as interest rates . Maybe we could hit those two topics before we open it up to some questions from the audience .  Thank you . Given the recent news on Freddie , Fannie , AIG MBIA , Attorney General , U .S . downgrade , how do owners get comfortable with the idea that there\\'s no big hole left in the balance sheet ?  Right . We\\'re going to move now to the issue of bad debt . Big questions around the 2009 present period of loans versus 2005 versus 2008 vintages . When will the current loans from 2009 to the present overcome those from the 2005 to 2008 period ?  In regards to profitability , looking at the balance sheet , taking another view , is it possible for the bank over an entire business cycle to average a 1% return on assets , and a 10% return on equity ?  I\\'m going to squeeze in the question on net interest income , which seems not all is interesting and some of the things we\\'ve been talking about , but it\\'s still over half of your revenues . Obviously , a very difficult and increasingly difficult rate environment , we\\'re seeing some loan growth out there . How do you think about net interest income playing out near-term , medium-term if we dont get any help from rate environment ?  Okay . I\\'m Peter Ganucheau , Carlson Capital . Brian , I heard two things . I heard delinquencies go down to normal this year and next , and then I heard legacy asset servicing costs would come down over 2013 and 2014. So I\\'m trying to [ph] foot (25:50) the two â?? and is it because there is a little bit of a lag there in the delinquencies â?? just the costs or -  And on the lending side , talk about the pipeline there . You talked about pulling back a little bit in trade finance . I think the loans were still up about 10%, 11% for the year which is quite strong . And what\\'s the outlook in terms of magnitude , if you care to share , but just the key drivers from here as well ? Yeah . Obviously , leverage has become more of a binding constraint , not just for U .S . banks , but for European banks as well . And it has prompted a whole discussion around balance sheet re-pricing and whether you\\'re going to see some low ROA areas improve over time . When you think about the whole concept of bank balance sheet re-pricing , is it still just theoretical , or are you starting to see it show up in certain pockets of your businesses ? Do you think , as demand for bank balance sheet grows as the economy continues to strengthen , that will be a catalyst for some re-pricing in those areas ? Brian , there has been a lot of talk coming out of Washington in terms of potential changes that the FHFA is looking for in terms of underwriting . As you look across your origination platform , are you guys making any changes in terms of the overlays you have on any of the production and if you are making changes , are these big enough to really make a difference in terms of the bottom line ? Bruce , I was wondering in terms of the core net interest income , you mention that the seasonally adjusted starting point for Q1 would be $10.6B , but it sounds like you expect that to keep grinding higher with the debt paydowns and rates being a little bit higher on the long end . And the $300mm that we saw this quarter , is that a good representation of the pace that core NII could grow at ? Okay . Any material change in your interest rate sensitivity overall , Bruce , to long rates and/or short rates ? A couple of questions , one on the NIM discussion that we just were having . When you look at what happened with the yield and the cost of funds , it looks like youâ??re getting a little bit more competitive on non-resi consumer and Iâ??m just wondering how to think about how youâ??re looking to shift either the loan growth going forward and how youâ??re thinking about that loan yield relative to your cost of funds in an environment where NIV probably doesnâ??t grow as much as it had been in the past , maybe your cost of funds is flattening out or potentially increasing a little bit ? Sure , no , itâ??s an interesting mix shift because youâ??ve got a little bit of shrinkage going on obviously with the legacy resi still coming off , yet the yields there are increasing . And on the non-resi consumer , youâ??ve got some yield compression happening but your loan growth at the margin inflecting more positively . And at the same time , your cost of funds looks like itâ??s probably settling out here and potentially even going up a little bit . I mean , NIV average balances were still up Q-on-Q but end of period was down . So thatâ??s kind of the core context of the question . And when do you think you get that inflection point in loan growth ? I mean , clearly itâ??s a function of legacy basically not weighing on the loan growth overall . When does that inflection point happen ? Weâ??re seeing some peers that came out yesterday actually increasing liquidity and long term debt levels to meet the LCR . I think you guys are starting at a higher point maybe than they were . But just give us a sense of maybe where you are for LCR with the current proposals ? And as we think about kind of the net impact of long-term debt running off at the holding company , increasing at the bank , how does that all shake out on a net basis this year ? Yeah , I wanted to come back to the debt footprint discussion , and just looking on page 11, you can see total average long-term debt down $27B y-over-y and at the same time , looking at page seven of the presentation , the time to required funding expanded from 33 months to 38 months . So Iâ??m just curious , is there some other liability that is extending while youâ??re bringing down the debt footprint ? And how can we gauge for the year aheadâ?¦? What Iâ??m getting at is how much further can you get â?? how can we triangulate on how much further room there might be in the debt reduction ? And on the jumbo loans , I mean how â?? I know a lot of the institutions are going after the jumbo product . I donâ??t think you break â?? I donâ??t see it â?? you donâ??t break out your jumbo product , but is that an area of focus for you guys ? And if it is , what type of yields are you getting on that product ? Okay . Fair enough . Iâ??ve had a number of clients ask me the question this morning about the significant increase in the yields on the securities portfolio just from Q3 to the fourth , and obviously long rates are up a lot . But is it just that ? Or can you link that to the couple hundred million dollar benefit that you were talking about in terms of the market related impact . And just kind of to add on to that , I mean , do you have a sense at this point , and this sort of goes back to the previous question , when rates do start up , how much will the profitability of â?? given everything youâ??ve done in the deposit gathering network , how profitable will that be in the next cycle as opposed to , letâ??s say , I donâ??t know , three or four years ago ? Got it . Just sequentially you would characterize the margins as largely flat . Is that right ? Okay . And loan utilization in commercial and wholesale , where does that stand ? With the forward curve the way it stands . And with that â?? with those assumptions , what sort of change do you expect with the certificates of deposits or CDs which are historically low for you and others ? Do you have money moving out of CDs at that point or not yet ? You\\'re around 15% of deposits; historically itâ??s around 35%. Okay . Question on the distressed portfolio that you\\'re running off; housing prices have started to stabilize , improve obviously in â?? significantly in some areas . And , the question is , are you able to take advantage of this firming up in home prices that we have been experiencing and the increase in transaction volume to start to accelerate the sale of distressed assets ?  One , you had some callouts on some nice gains , and I know a couple of other banks reporting here this cycle have done the same thing . Iâ??m wondering how much more in your pipeline do you think you have to extract some value from the mortgage-related portfolio here that youâ??re [indiscernible] (37:47)?   Thanks , okay . And then just lastly , there has been a lot of debate recently about how the Fed could potentially start to exit . Obviously in the [indiscernible] (39:33) they talked about that , and itâ??s been on some of the calls recently about how people are thinking about rate betas . I know from the 10-Q you have a relatively positive outlook for what rising rates does to your earnings stream . Could you just remind us what percentage of your deposits are consumer and how youâ??re thinking about rate betas in a rate rise environment relative to asset betas ? I just wanted to follow up quickly up on that deposit question . I noticed that non-interest-bearing was up 11%, interest-bearing up only 1%, so that speaks to your efforts . Do you think thereâ??s more to go there , or should we start to see deposit growth more in line with your peers at this point ? Right . Okay , great . And then on loan growth , you still have , as you mentioned , a couple of asset sales , still some legacy asset runoff . When do we start to see the inflection point in your view ? And maybe , if you can , give us a sense of underlying demand that youâ??re seeing in your customer group . Will that put any further pressure on NIM if youâ??re building more liquidity there ? A quick question on the matched book for at least the Fed funds sold and repurchased on the asset side was up 6.5% quarter on quarter . Itâ??s the opposite of what weâ??re seeing at a lot of banks and trends in the market , so Iâ??m just curious . Is there an opportunity to get closer to clients ? Is this a function of the fact that your SLR is in great shape so why not use it when you can ? Iâ??m just curious on whatâ??s underlying that trend . Got it . Switching topics , you did talk about pricing on commercial loans in the context of not seeing a meaningful increase in commercial loan balances this quarter and I guess alluded to the discipline that youâ??re exercising . Can you talk a little bit about the conditions that youâ??re seeing in the commercial loan market and where you think theyâ??re soft ? And just to follow up on that , when you say banks competing for that business , are you using the word bank in a traditional sense , or are you actually seeing a lot of the competition for those type of mid-market loans coming from outside of what we would think of as the traditional banking sector ? I was wondering . Youâ??ve got a little less than $250B of residential real estate loans and $90B of home equity . How much do you think those decline before those stabilize ? Because I think you tried to talk about it in terms of the overall loan growth , but those are really the categories that are shrinking . Do you have a sense as to where those categories will level out ? Great , and just a quick follow-up to the first one . You had mentioned investing some of the runoff from the mortgage and home equity portfolio in securities . Is that in the context of keeping those balances stable , or would you actually increase that portfolio ? Iâ??m going to ask you a couple questions . First off , youâ??ve been harvesting about $400mm worth of gains out of the debt portfolio . Is that in the sense of trying to minimize your AOCI risk when rates do go up as youâ??re shortening the portfolio , or do you just want to think about your strategy because thatâ??s been a pretty consistent flow-through over the last year ? So I just want to make sure that the gains are just an outflow of that overall strategy that you had talked about . Okay . When you look at the Consumer and Business Bank , you have a considerable amount more in deposits than you really have in loans , which to me seems a little bit more skewed than what you would normally expect . How do you strategically think you can utilize that balance sheet funding over time ? What are some of the initiatives that youâ??re doing to â?? because you should be able to penetrate that customer base with more lending ? And just lastly , and thanks for letting me ask you a few questions . If youâ??re looking at valuation of your servicing portfolio , it dropped off to 82BPS this quarter , which seems relatively low as the duration of that portfolio is extending . I know interest rates came back , so the models force you to write it back down . But when youâ??re looking at the prepayment speeds and the refinancing behavior , it seems like eventually that thereâ??s some value as that portfolio lasts a lot longer than the model assumes at this point . A couple follow-ups . First on the deposit data , I appreciate you giving us the color for every 100 basis point increase it would help by $3.4B . You described the deposit base . But what is the actual deposit data that you use to come up with the $3.4B benefit ? Alright . So , I think thatâ??s in the ballpark of one of your large peers but below some others . And is the reason that would be below others is because itâ??s a lot of branch-based deposits ? Okay . As it relates to loan paydowns , Bruce , you mentioned that some bank loans declined as customers went to the capital markets; in a way , a type of disintermediation from the bank . Can you elaborate on that ? Are you still seeing that this quarter ? Do you think that was a one-off event , or is that something we should watch out for ? What Iâ??m getting to is , do you guys think this is an inflection point for loan growth ? I can find one of your large peers who implied that it is , and I can find a large regional bank who says itâ??s not . Where do you fall out on the spectrum ? You said , Brian , that middle-market utilization was up ever so slightly . Can you just give us that utilization number and where you stand ? So do you think this is an inflection point for loan growth , or is that an answer youâ??d rather not delve into ? And then what about kind of the core leakage , like this quarter you had that $400mm of core leakage from loan runoff; you didnâ??t mention that but do you expect to still have that battling against the debt benefit ?  Just trying to think of once we jump off , is there something about the $400mm that was elevated this quarter in terms of core leakage ? And why that might slow ? Is it just â?? is loan shrinkage slowing ? Is that the idea ?  But youâ??re paying on those that are less than two years of payments right ? The disagreements are coming about on those loans that have made over 25 payments right ?  If I could just follow up a little bit on the net interest income commentary . I guess , first , when you talk about the jumping off point , that $10.25B , I guess Iâ??m trying to think why itâ??s not at $10.5B roughly including some of the liability management . And then , from there , weâ??ve got to make adjustments up or down for loans , securities , and interest-rate environment ?  Taking out the accounting nuances of premium amortization hits , the market-related hedge ineffectiveness , like as we just think about the core portfolio and some of the repricing that you might see in the securities book if rates stay here , I mean I would assume thereâ??s just kind of some natural drag to the core NIM if rates were to stay here that we would expect .  Then I guess that youâ??re not the only bank but like a number of banks have kind of brushed off the low rate impact on the securities book . And I know it takes time for the securities portfolio to reprice but if we adjust your yield for some of the one-timers , it seems like itâ??s around 2.8%. And my guess is the stuff that youâ??re adding is 1.5% to 1.7% right now . So I mean hypothetically if rates stay here itâ??s just kind of a constant bleed down to that , right ?  Should we assume that the runoff portfolios more than offset incremental growth ? Or are they offsetting now ? How do we think about kind of the overall balance sheet size ?  What inning are we in from the negative impact from this very low interest rate environment ? You had one bank say it was pretty much done . Theyâ??re not going to have a whole lot more negative impact . You had another large bank saying well itâ??s more than half done . Itâ??s mostly done . And a third bank has said , well actually itâ??s going to hurt a lot more if rates stay here . So where do you stand on that question ? And specifically , I note this quarter , the deposit rate only declined by two basis points whereas the yield on loans were down 11BPS and commercial loan yields were down 17BPS .  And just one follow up , so Iâ??m looking at page 10 of the supplement , and Iâ??m sure you know these numbers . Total commercial yield from Q1 to Q2 went from 3.52% to 3.35%. Thatâ??s a 17 basis point decline in the commercial loan yield . So is there noise there ? What gives you such good confidence that that decline is pretty much done ?  So that jumping off point of what , would say take $10.2B of NII , you expect that to be flat or higher , then ?  I guess I should have mentioned , too , we certainly encourage questions from the audience if there\\'s anyone , otherwise â?? okay , so I guess can you talk about the growth in loans and deposits , maybe just kind of broadly speaking , can you talk a little bit about the outlook going forward from here ? And as you point out , deposits have been growing at record levels , you\\'ve recently seen a small pickup in the credit card balances , kind of what are your expectations broadly for deposit and loan growth [ph] coming from there (14:15)? Great , thanks , Bruce , before we turn it to the audience for questions , maybe a couple of polling questions for the audience . But to the audience , if you dont currently own the shares of Bank of America or are underweighted stock , what would cause you to change your mind: one , higher rates and improved NII; two , more expense cuts; three , a buyback; four , a better trading environment; and five , post the current settlement , I\\'m increasing my position ? So number one , higher rates and improved net interest income performance , which I think you did a good job articulating your upside to .  Maybe if we go to the next question , while recent credit quality trends have been consistently improving , which of the following loan segments do you believe represents the greatest risk/return on credit quality: one , mortgage; two , home equity; three , card; four , auto; five , leveraged lending; six , share re [repurchase]; or seven , none , not worried at all ? So four , auto , followed by leveraged lending . Maybe , Bruce , just talk to in terms of any pockets of concern you\\'re worried about . I know you already touched on some of those segments . Give us some insight where you\\'re seeing loan growth . We\\'ve seen conflicting stories so far , a couple stories . So if you can , give us what you\\'re seeing in loan growth . Thanks . Hi , Bruce , it\\'s Jimmy Hanna with PEAK6. Can you just talk a little bit about what you\\'re seeing on the deposit side in terms of flows; and if the flows are staying elevated , where the investment opportunities are , and then how that plays in with net interest income and your outlook there ? Okay . And then separately on page 9, you go through the NII . Could you just give a little more color around the hedge that youâ??ve got ? I know youâ??ve got one on the AFS portfolio . And give us a sense as to how youâ??re managing that right now ?  Thatâ??s a really great update and I appreciate it , but going back to the question , part of the question was how do you treat modified loans ? When you modify the first , what type of activity do you take on the second ? And then how do you classify that second lien ?  Bruce R . Thompson Chief Financial Officer , Bank of America Corp .And if you modify , like under these various modification programs , and if you modify the first , would you modify the second also ? And then would you classify that as a current or TDR or a non-performing loan ?  Okay . Bruce , a question for you . The core margin , ex the market-related assets , I think has hit 3% again . Is that maintainable ? And if I could just ask you to speculate or forecast , I mean when we get back to a more normal rate environment , what is an achievable sort of normalized margin for the company ?  Hi . Bruce , just following up on that last point , just sounds like for this year net interest income was $11B this quarter . It sounds like youâ??re kind of running in place perhaps the next couple quarters unless something changes on the rate front or loan growth ?  Good morning . My question was on loan growth . And I see global banking loans are flat and G1 loans are flat and consumer is down , and it looks like some sort of deceleration . So are you seeing a swap from at least the large loans to the capital markets ? Or how do you describe whatâ??s taking place there ?Oh , sure . Thatâ??s fair . I guess Iâ??m just trying to understand , as far as the MI impact is concerned , is it that BofA is providing the rep and warrant that valid insurance exists and then therefore the GSE has a claim against BofA ? And then BofA has to go pursue that actual â?? has then a claim against the MI ? So can you help me understand how that works ?  Just want to circle back on the margin , NII commentary . In terms of , I think youâ??re basically saying that we should think about NII basically holding . But I want to go back , this quarter you had the benefit thatâ??s not going to repeat , but then what were the drags ? Again , you had mentioned earlier , maybe I missed it in terms of some consumer yield pressure , but then is there also core asset yield pressure because of the low rate environment ?  Got it . And then in terms of outside of that , commercial pricing competition , asset yield pricing , asset yield pressure . Is that manageable it seems like ?  And do you still have confidence in the â?? maybe itâ??s an outdated range now , of 45 to 50 on an annual basis . Is that still valid ? Or have things changed enough that , that needs to be rethought ?  Yeah . I guess before we go to the audience , I am going to ask the audience some questions . If you currently dont own the shares of BAC or underwrite the stock , what would cause you to change your mind ? One , more clarity on mortgage repurchase exposure; two , [indiscernible] (18.10) on the expense reduction program; three , a buyback; four , better capital markets outlook; five , need to see a pullback given recent outperformance; and six; higher rates and improved margin or improved net interest income outlook ?  [indiscernible] (18:32) 52%, wow . Bruce , the majority of people , still stuck on mortgage repurchase . Can you just talk about â?? I dont think it\\'s something you really touched on in your prepared presentation in terms of where we stand , first off , with respect to The Bank of New York settlement . And then secondly , maybe on the remaining exposures , obviously there\\'s a big uptick in claims in second quarter results as you already talked to , your thoughts around that ?  That\\'s helpful . I think the second most picked answer was interest rates and net interest income . I guess the last couple quarters there\\'s been a fair amount of moving pieces around NII , I think , some confusion . Can you just try to level set us and maybe give us just some near-term expectations in terms of what you\\'re thinking ?  I guess , Bruce , we talked before a little bit about net interest income , but as we look at the balance sheet , we have seen I guess contraction over the last several quarters â?? years as you kind of remixed it and sold them to foreign businesses and exit non-core stuff . Where are we in terms of the process and I guess ultimately when do you start to think kind of re-grow the balance sheet ? I guess there\\'s a little bit of growth in 2Q . But what inning are you , do you feel like , in the divestiture process and just the overall shrinkage exercise ?  Got it . You mentioned you\\'re seeing good loan growth in the corporate â?? kind of large corporate space . Maybe talk to kind of overall loan trends . I guess your loan growth was kind of a little bit subdued in the first quarter and in terms of I guess there\\'s some runoff , where you are in that process and just how you see that playing out over the course of the year ? Okay , thanks , and then a follow-up on your comment regarding the outlook for NII where you indicated that NII , excluding market-related items , could build from the $10.4B at Q2 2013. Could you describe how youâ??re thinking about that ? Iâ??ve had a lot of conversations over the last quarter about what you put in your Q , which is [ph] a 100-basis-point [indiscernible] (31:42) meaningful increase in EPS . Thatâ??s got to come more from reinvesting the cash flow of the securities portfolio . So could you give us a sense of how you drive higher NII ? And would you be looking to shift some of the liquidity pool into securities ? Obviously , it would be longer duration than the liquidity pool . Okay , great . And then just lastly on the WIM pre-tax margin , pretty strong number this quarter , and I know last quarter you called out some one-timers . Were there any one-timers in that this quarter ? Okay . Over time includes a higher interest rate environment ? Okay . Last thing for me , on the NII , could you just review that again ? The benefit youâ??ve talked about , thatâ??s a benefit from the 10-year moving up , and did you say that you received $300mm of that benefit thatâ??s already in the $10.4B that we see this quarter ? Okay , thank you . And , Bruce â?? yeah , and you have additional benefits beyond that if short rates rise ? Is that the point you were making earlier ? And then on your AFS portfolio , I think you guys have indicated in the past it was a roughly two-year duration . Given your allocation to RMBS in that portfolio , did we see an extension of that duration ? Can you kind of help us get an idea about what the impact might have been during the quarter ? And then can you add some color â?? weâ??ve been in the â?? rates have really moved up . Gain-on-sale margins you know are coming down . But can you give some color where [ph] youâ??re seeing (54:10) gain-on-sale margins so far into the quarter , or it is too early to tell ? Okay . And then , overall , in terms of liquidity , it looked like your non-loan earning assets were down by almost $40B this quarter . How much further do you suppose you can run those down as you reduce your debt footprint ? Could you talk a little bit about whether you either have â?? it doesnâ??t look like it , but whether you have or are planning to retain mortgage loans in H2? And Iâ??ve got a follow-up question , too . The second question I have is somewhat imprecise , and I apologize in advance . But I think what everybody is waiting for with your stock and with the earnings outlook is for this massive deposit-gathering network to get profitable . And we understand that that is a function of short rates going up . Is there an ideal â?? can you walk us through this ? Is there an ideal yield curve ? Is there an absolute level of short rates ? What do we have to see to begin to see the branches get massively profitable ? On the put backs themselves , if you look , excuse me , if you look at the level theyâ??ve kind of leveled off at this high pace so itâ??s good that theyâ??re not picking up . Has the FHA got more involved ? Are they putting back loans ? And are they increasing the dialogue ? Because it seems that way in certain spots ?  Okay . Last one , quickie . In the home equity book can you give us a bigger-than-a-bread box type number on how much of the book is interest only or due to start amortizing principle soon ?  A couple of questions . First just to clarify on the net interest income and NIM outlook . I think if I heard you correctly if rates stay where they are right now , youâ??d expect the NIM net interest income dollars to be relatively stable in Q4?  Okay . So itâ??s actually up vs . the reported Q2 or Q3 level because you donâ??t have the one-time hits from hedging or amortization ?  Oh . Thanks . One follow-up on the NII , and then a question on the mortgage . On the NII , you indicated that if rates stayed where they are today , youâ??d be back to Q2 levels of NII . That takes into consideration the prepaids that are going to be coming , hitting you in fourth quarter . Obviously there was a reasonable amount of folks that havenâ??t yet been able to close on their refi at this stage ?  Okay . And then assets â?? youâ??re asset sensitive . Can you tell us how your asset sensitivity changed q-on-q ?  Or where you are now vs . where you were at quarter end ?  And that includes the planned long-term debt roll off ?  Okay . And can you give us a sense of how much long-term debt youâ??re planning on rolling off over the course of the next three , four quarters ?   Much , much less . Okay . And then in terms of France did you mention any sovereign-related debt ?  Okay . The 6.75% to 7%, does include the risk weighted asset mitigation expectations ?  As a follow-up on the GSE piece , I mean , what\\'s changed from that side of things ? I know in January , you settled with Freddie . You thought the charges and reserves you took for Fannie would be most of it . You topped it off in April . Now it sounds like not only are you topping it off this quarter , but that you are providing most of that â?? or a big chunk of that $5 billion going forward . I mean , are they approaching things differently than they were before ? And I guess , what gives you confidence that this is kind of it in terms of their approach and it won\\'t change again ?   And just lastly all in , I mean , you removed some of the risk to declining home prices . As you work your models for some sensitivity , what if home prices go down say 10%, what would that mean in terms of additional charges ?  Great . So that should mean that if this process is ongoing that you would expect to see loan growth accelerate modestly from here ?  And I guess what are the puts and takes from there ? Did you say that you hope to get some debt reductions or the benefit from debt reductions could offset the headwinds that you expect from low rates and runoff ? Did I hear that right ?  Okay . And then just separate topic here , as we think about maybe some of the interest rates out there outside the Treasuries , so like mortgage rates , the agency RMBS rates , and I think a lot of other asset classes youâ??ve seen rates come down in the security side , how do you just conceptually think about managing the discretionary book from here ? I understand youâ??re trying to grow C&I loans a little bit more , but obviously the discretionary book is still a pretty big chunk and you have a lot of deposits that you need to try and balance .  Okay . And then separately , thereâ??s some regulators who are suggesting that the debt portion of the balance sheet from senior debt through â?? well , actually all the way through equity should be somewhere in the 25% to 30% range . And Iâ??m wondering if , this is a Title 2 question , and Iâ??m wondering if youâ??ve had any conversations with regulators about that ? Do you feel that thereâ??s anything that you would need to do on that side of the debt stack ?  Okay . So as we model through the next couple of years we should assume the same pace of long-term debt decline or in a little bit of acceleration into the next year or two ?  First question on loan growth , what has commercial loan utilization done this quarter vs . the last quarter or two ?  And I noticed that commercial loans grew 14% annualized linked-quarter and that the period end loans were up a lot more than the average loans . Is anything happening in the economy to accelerate that commercial loan growth I guess at the end of the quarter ? Or is this Bank of America specific strategy ?  And you said loan growth is a priority . Are you willing to lower rates in order to stimulate more loan growth ?  All right . So demand is not a whole lot better . Youâ??re not doing it with rates , youâ??re gaining share from foreign banks , that might be part of it , anything else youâ??d want to add to that list ?  But while â?? I mean just with spreads the way they are , why would you want to hold any mortgage loans on the balance sheet ?  And then just last question is your dispute with Fannie Mae . I believe youâ??re not selling any loans to Fannie Mae . Youâ??re selling to Freddie Mac which are both really run by the FHFA . Is the dispute with Fannie Mae at all hindering your ability to sell loans to the GSEs ?  Unless someone wants to pay you a lot of money for it , but I hear you . And finally the focus on earnings growth and loan growth , I think you talked effectively at all the price competition . Iâ??m curious if the industry has the potential to be lulled to sleep in this low rate environment . So you mentioned youâ??re getting the same kind of spreads on new loan originations . Itâ??s coming at a lower rate , but weâ??re in an excellent credit environment right  now , but curious if we were to see it turning the other way if you feel like the industry might be putting on loans that are â?? weâ??re being lulled to sleep on spread , but the rates actually can get eaten up pretty quickly if thereâ??s a turn in credit .  I appreciate all of that .  Inside the average balance sheet , the securities yields went up 11BPS in the quarter . Most banks are trending lower as things run off . This is part of your defending the NIM , so I get it . Just curious , is it just expanding a little bit on the duration curve ? Just curious what you are doing on the asset side to help support those yields .  Yeah , okay , that\\'s fair . And then thinking about maybe the fact that you guys might be in the market to sell another chunk of MSRs or at least you hear about that through speculation from various sources . Is the idea behind that , we are at a point where that is not really a capital issue for you all anymore , right , because you are below the threshold from that perspective . So is it more about getting an opportunity to further eliminate and push down these legacy costs or is it that you just strategically dont view the business as very attractive and you just want to be out of it altogether ? Can you help maybe give some color around that thought process ?  Right . It is just that when you stopped originating through Fannie , the share came down rather sharply in a short period of time . So I was just wondering if , with higher throughput , you might be able to do more there .  Okay . Do you just know generally I mean because you margin was up; that is good , and the securities yield is up 11BPS , but do you think it was â?? would have been down if not for that ?  You guys have done a great job countering the net interest margin pressure obviously with managing your long-term debt down . And maybe itâ??s too early to think about this , but obviously under orderly liquidation authority in Dodd-Frank , there is some provision for bail-in debt and I was wondering how you guys are thinking about that and how you might implement it over time ?  Okay . All right . So you talked a little about the balanced loans and deposits . What strategies do you have to generate kind of higher loans out of that business ? That seems to be one of the key goals here .  So good loan growth on the commercial and C&I and commercial real estate side . Just curious . What kind of yield is that bringing â?? being brought on ? And from what I understand , thereâ??s pretty reasonable competition for those new loans . So Iâ??m curious on how you balance the growth and margin pressure in the markets .  Okay . And then switching gears on the net interest income , Bruce , do you expect maybe to do better than the core $10.6B now that you have a little bit of loan growth and then day count , or do you expect to stay on that level ?  Most of my questions have been asked and answered already , but just a quick question in terms of the deposit costs . Youâ??ve got your domestic deposit costs down to sub-20BPS . Youâ??ve got somewhat higher costs outside the U .S ., although obviously much smaller balances . Is there any â?? how are you thinking about being able to reduce the non-U .S . deposit costs , particularly in the time deposit categories , over the next six to twelve months ?  Okay , and then just one final question . You had mentioned the time to required funding has come down a little bit from the end of last year , and you intend on maintaining that as above two years . Should we think about that coming down closer to 24 months over the next six to twelve months , or is it too early to tell ?  I have a quick follow-up , and I just want to make sure I heard you guys right . Did you say that 50% of your total originations were HARP ? And if so , would that imply that â?? I guess what Iâ??m asking is do you think you can replace that with normal retail volume if HARP starts to dissipate in the back half of the year ?  So , just wanted to touch on a couple of things that you mentioned during your prepared remarks here . One is on the NII actions that you were talking about you might take with the securities portfolio as a way to protect the OCI but might have a hit on the top line when you do that . Could you just talk through what kind of size youâ??re thinking about; what the triggers for that action might be ? Okay . Last one on mortgage . Just curious what percentage of current originations youâ??re keeping on balance sheet . And then a related part two would be how much is the unfinished question around repurchase risk constraining ? Any mortgage lending or is it really still a function of demand at this point ? So is it fair to assume that you guys are near or at the 100% LCR threshold ? And I guess secondarily , should we expect balance sheet growth to start â?? loan deposit growth , balance sheet growth start to pick up from here , or do you still have a lot more to do ? Okay . And this buy ticket or these kind of actions that you might take , how might they impact your projections of rate sensitivity to rising short and long rates ? Okay . So youâ??re not talking about a major restructuring of the bond portfolio ? Itâ??s just being patient in terms of investing ? I think I might have misunderstood the actions . Got it , okay , totally understood , thank you . And , Bruce , just in terms of the FAS 91 or the premium amortization charges that move around with the 10-year , is that pretty proportional to how the 10-year moves up and down , or are there levels where it stops being a straight line impact ? Okay . And as far as the outlook for rates , have you changed your rate assumption for next year given what the 10-year has done ? Okay . And then just separately , within the C&I lending book you talked about pricing pressure as well as some paydowns . But I guess specifically on the pricing pressure , what are you seeing now vs . a quarter or two ago when you were still trying to grow or growing the book in terms of â?? not just the magnitude of pricing but what types of products ? Question on , first .  Of all , the optimization that you talked about with respect to commercial deposits around $15B and the , I think , roughly $12B in securities financing transactions . Should we look at those two things as directly related to each other ? A quick one on loan growth . So at first glance , it looked kind of weak . It was seemed to be driven by Consumer . I just want to make sure Iâ??ve got sort of the right adjustments here that I think you guys have laid out . In mortgage , $12.5B decline sequentially , but should we be backing out the $2.5B of NPL sales and then the $6.5B of agency conversion from that decline , so you get kind of a normalized decline rate sequentially of more like $3.5B on the mortgage side ? Sure , sure . And maybe if you could , is it possible to give us an idea about the runoff portfolio , whatâ??s left in that at this stage , and what your guys expectations are for like a runoff headwind , just so we can think about it for modeling purposes ? Cool . And then last one , I know you guys have talked about here the repositioning that you guys want to take as far as AOCI risk and such . When we think about the AOCI hit that you guys lay out vs . other money centers in the interest rate shock , itâ??s a little bit higher than where some of the other folks are . And so , hoping to maybe get a little bit of color on where the current duration is , where you expect the duration to go based upon the actions that you take , and then maybe help us also to square the circle of understanding the larger AOCI hit and whether thatâ??s a result of a barbelling with the portfolio or what . Okay . So is it right then to assume that duration on the FS portfolio is a little under three years , or is that not a correct inference ? And then if I could just ask a follow-up on the non-U .S . commercial loans , a couple of competitors have mentioned that there has been some weakness in trade finance lending , and Iâ??m just curious how much , if any , that has affected the loan growth within the non-U .S . commercial side of the balance sheet . Thanks , Bruce . Actually , I want to go back to your comments . You said that about $50 billion in 2014 maturities probably wouldn\\'t be completely refinanced . I was just wondering if next year , would you take that opportunity then to change the composition of that funding either in terms of duration or in terms of seniority or both ?  Can you talk about the commercial loan growth and how much is due to draw down of existing credit lines vs . expansion in new areas ?  And do you think that you can grow net interest income from that level of $11B in Q4 going forward ? Whatâ??s going to be the drivers ?  Okay . So thatâ??s a good run rate , and from there , it depends on whether rates rise and whether loan growth picks up ?  Okay . And then you also gave a data point here on the servicing book , and 8% decline in delinquent loans serviced . Can you give us an update on what portion of the total servicing book is delinquent ?  Right . Proportionally a different piece of the puzzle .  Okay . Thanks , thatâ??s helpful . And then second question would be on interest-bearing deposits . Unlike other banks we saw a pretty big step down in interest-bearing deposits . I know some of that was probably intentional CD run-off but it really happened in most deposit categories . Any color on that ? And in your mind did that have anything to do with sort of the snafu around the charge related to debit cards that you then took back ?  Youâ??re not getting any feedback from the FHA or from any other kind of government entities that , that â?? that those guarantees could be at risk in conjunction with any kind of servicing issues that might be happening on those particular loans ?  Okay . Just in terms of magnitude , any numbers you can put like where you think you might be on a run rate basis by the end of 2012?    Mortgage companies have often shot for that macro hedge and the balance between origination and servicing and so as rates rise and origination slows , do you feel like you have that balance now ?  And this number that you\\'re talking about going to $2.1 billion by the end of this year , ultimately do you feel like it should be a $500 million number and that\\'ll take another year or two ?  So it\\'s how much of the 2015 you could pull into 2014?  I know you get this question a lot about the revenue impact from New BAC . Is that something that you worry about ? Do you feel like you\\'re adjusting the cost base for revenues that have already left ? Or are there still some risks of losing some revenues as you take these costs out ?  So switching over to NII and net interest income , you mentioned you kind of stabilized that around $10.5 billion per quarter . What\\'s needed to kind of break out of that range ?  And the move in the 10-year , that helps somewhat on just some of the hedges you have and when the market moves up ?  You\\'ve shown a little progress on the loan growth front . Obviously you\\'ve got to outrun your runoff book , but have you kind of opened the spigot a little bit and let people go forth and lend ? It sounded like you opened up a little bit .  Your earnings growth outlook probably is not predicated on a lot of balance sheet growth .  There\\'s a couple questions in here about the , again , the too-big-to-fail theme , and do we think the living will\\'s liquidity capital can really end the perception of needing a bailout ?  Could you please talk about your expectations for net interest margin for next year and , in particular , how you\\'re thinking about the outlook has changed over the last few months ? Can you just talk a little bit more about â?? can I just follow up on just some of the drivers . What you\\'re seeing in terms of asset spreads , for example . And I think sort of corporate lending is maybe more competitive than we might have expected . Another driver is although short rates might â?? aren\\'t likely to rise in 2014, the short end of the yield curve , which has actually not really moved very much might steepen , so presumably that would be positive for you . You\\'ve mentioned a couple of times that loan growth is still slow . What do you think will change that and what\\'s your outlook for 2014?   Okay . And so you highlighted that your delinquents are down half from the asset sales and half from your own actions ?  Bruce , I was just wondering on the net interest income side , do you think that the core NII should kind of grind higher , at a similar pace that we saw this quarter ? It looks like it was up $100mm assuming no big change in rates ?  And how should we think about the market-sensitive component ? Do you still have the NII hedges on ? Or is it really the FAS 91 that adds volatility from here ?  And over time does that FAS 91 effect dissipate over time ? Or is that always going to be with you ?  Okay and then any update on your rate sensitivity relative to where you stood at the end of last quarter for 100 basis point move in [ph] loan (45:17) rates ?  Just as we think about the overall size of the balance sheet , you mentioned managing the securities book with OCI risk in mind and obviously the securities that come down as you mentioned this quarter while the loans are growing . How do we think about the net impact of those two , I guess , looking out the next several quarters ?  Yeah , and Iâ??m really focused on the loans plus the securities because obviously liquidity levels can vary quarter-to-quarter and the trading book can vary quarter-to-quarter so just I mean loans are growing nicely but is being offset by securities coming down , so Iâ??m really just focused on those two components .  Great . So flattish balance sheet , but optimizing the capital usage and then obviously the NIM probably benefiting from the remix there ?  Okay . Switching gears , in terms of loan growth , whatâ??s the loan utilization level ? And what are you seeing as far as acceleration or deceleration in loan growth ?  I just have a few cleanup sort of questions . With respect to the long-term debt footprint then , have you talked about how much of the $40B that is coming due that you would expect to refi or are you going to let it all just go ?  Iâ??m looking for a quick comment on the overall loan picture . There are always a lot of puts and takes . So the Commercial side grew by 8% y-over-y . The Consumer shrunk by 4.7%.Summing it all up , I donâ??t want to put words in your mouth . But if you look at the net of up just 50BPS for total loans year on year , it sounds like itâ??s better than that just because of the runoff . I just wanted to make sure that I get that specific on it . I just want to understand the dynamic of the net interest income outlook I guess in Q2. Is the increase in lower-yielding liquidity on an average basis and thatâ??s going to push the NII down a little bit that overwhelms the day count , is that whatâ??s happening in Q2? Okay . And whatâ??s helping it grind higher beyond Q2, Bruce , just as a reminder ? What helps it grow in the third and fourth quarter and beyond ? Thatâ??s from the Fed , right , thatâ??s there the April release from the Fed ? Right . No , what I was referring to was that Basel had come out with something in March , which one would assume that eventually the Fed will adopt for the standardized approach to counterparty credit . And I think JPM alluded on Friday to the idea that that could add , depending on whether you look at the holding company or the bank units upwards of 20BPS to the leverage ratio because it takes into account the [ph] net (1:19:35) to a greater extent . And I was wondering if you had done any preliminary work on that . If I could just follow up on the net interest income comment , I guess just bigger picture , it seems like the outlook is a little bit lower than what you had previously thought . And I guess I think about building liquidity tends to be dilutive to NIM but not net interest income dollars , and some of the things you point to are seasonal . So just like big picture , I guess when you think about where you had thought NII might be a couple quarters ago looking out , whatâ??s worse ? Is it more runoff than you thought , less loan growth because youâ??re tightening up vs . what some others are doing , or is it just the rates havenâ??t moved at all or some combination of all that ? Got you . Secondly , you called out that mortgage servicing hedging was unfavorable this quarter . If you look at the environment , it seemed like Iâ??ve seen in others that it was actually a positive , not a negative . What was in particular happening in your mortgage servicing hedging ? Got you . And then lastly , when you think about moving from your mortgage-backed securities into agencies and Treasuries that have shorter durations , thatâ??s throwing you to become more asset sensitive . Are you thinking about because the liquidity rules are making the balance sheet become more asset sensitive , employing more interest rate swaps or off-balance sheet hedging to rebalance and not become so much more asset sensitive due to these other pressures ? And then just finally , Bruce , you indicated that net interest income is going to decline somewhat due to liquidity issues , et cetera . Is that then going to be true of the NIM , or is there anything in the mix change coming in the near term that can send the NIM up or the adjusted NIM up from this 2.36% level ? Iâ??m looking for a quick comment on the overall loan picture . There are always a lot of puts and takes . So the Commercial side grew by 8% y-over-y . The Consumer shrunk by 4.7%.Summing it all up , I donâ??t want to put words in your mouth . But if you look at the net of up just 50BPS for total loans year on year , it sounds like itâ??s better than that just because of the runoff . I just wanted to make sure that I get that specific on it . I just want to understand the dynamic of the net interest income outlook I guess in Q2. Is the increase in lower-yielding liquidity on an average basis and thatâ??s going to push the NII down a little bit that overwhelms the day count , is that whatâ??s happening in Q2? Okay . And whatâ??s helping it grind higher beyond Q2, Bruce , just as a reminder ? What helps it grow in the third and fourth quarter and beyond ? Thatâ??s from the Fed , right , thatâ??s there the April release from the Fed ? Right . No , what I was referring to was that Basel had come out with something in March , which one would assume that eventually the Fed will adopt for the standardized approach to counterparty credit . And I think JPM alluded on Friday to the idea that that could add , depending on whether you look at the holding company or the bank units upwards of 20BPS to the leverage ratio because it takes into account the [ph] net (1:19:35) to a greater extent . And I was wondering if you had done any preliminary work on that . If I could just follow up on the net interest income comment , I guess just bigger picture , it seems like the outlook is a little bit lower than what you had previously thought . And I guess I think about building liquidity tends to be dilutive to NIM but not net interest income dollars , and some of the things you point to are seasonal . So just like big picture , I guess when you think about where you had thought NII might be a couple quarters ago looking out , whatâ??s worse ? Is it more runoff than you thought , less loan growth because youâ??re tightening up vs . what some others are doing , or is it just the rates havenâ??t moved at all or some combination of all that ? Got you . Secondly , you called out that mortgage servicing hedging was unfavorable this quarter . If you look at the environment , it seemed like Iâ??ve seen in others that it was actually a positive , not a negative . What was in particular happening in your mortgage servicing hedging ? Got you . And then lastly , when you think about moving from your mortgage-backed securities into agencies and Treasuries that have shorter durations , thatâ??s throwing you to become more asset sensitive .

Is that then going to be true of the NIM , or is there anything in the mix change coming in the near term that can send the NIM up or the adjusted NIM up from this 2.36% level ? Okay . Since you reported , we\\'ve seen the voluntary restructuring in Greece , where CDS hasn\\'t triggered . What does that tell you , if anything , about the effectiveness of sovereign CDS as a hedge against the growth positions that you have ?  Given your sizeable liquidity , why dont you capture some of that CVA [indiscernible] (35:41) by buying in some discount bonds or discount trust-preferreds or preferreds ?  Is there any risk of sort of â?? if there\\'s a downshift in that growth , is there a risk of loan losses that are sort of unanticipated , any thoughts on that ?  The leverage ratio is not a constraint for you , but it is obviously for some of your peers . Can you talk a little bit about bank balance sheet repricing ? Do you think it\\'s starting to take place in certain businesses , and over time how material do you think it could be ? And can you give us a little bit more detail on that portfolio , both in terms of the pace of the run-off and also the assumptions on the $10 billion reserve you\\'ve got against that ?  A couple of questions on emerging markets and then on the funding side , if thatâ??s all right . First , thank you for the AOCI slide; my question is , on past calls weâ??ve talked about in some of the emerging markets the operations . In order to maintain liquidity , youâ??ve kept local government bond portfolios . Given what happened in emerging markets in Q4, did these take a valuation hit at all ? And how does that flow through ? Is that then on the local level , or does that flow through AOCI ? Okay , thanks . Moving on to some of the funding details , you put in slide 32 issuance over the course of 2013. And I was wondering if 2014 issuance is â?? if youâ??re looking to follow a similar issuance pattern there , or if youâ??re looking to front-load more issuance given where rates have gone down to and where credit spreads are . Okay . And you had also talked about credit card securitizations as a main issuance vehicle for funding the bank . Have you also reviewed looking at the senior deposit market as well ? I just wanted to get your thoughts around the prepositioning of any debt ahead of OLA and maybe also to touch on the point if you do think that OLA requires some sort of debt issued at the holding company . How do you think that debt could be deployed within the group and at the bank level , whether that would be an exclusive portfolio that you would buy some more HQLA assets , or whether you would repay FHLB borrowings ? Thank you . Okay . And , Eric , you mentioned the cap on Level 2 assets . Looking at your disclosures vs . some of your peers , you have relatively high cash balances , and you teased out agency RMBS . Even with that cap , you have pretty low agency balances . Do you think thereâ??s room to optimize and generate some growth in NII as you do that ? If you turn to slide 12, the $20B of benchmark debt that you plan to issue next year â?? or this year , does that include any preferred stock , or thatâ??s not part of this equation ? On the $300mm of Mexican loans that you identified , what types of loans to build â?? are they raw land loans or are they working capital loans ? What type of loans are they ? And in terms of your Transaction business , youâ??ve talked about the challenges that youâ??re having with the spreads and itâ??s been like this for some time because of the low rate environment . Can you share with us what kind of interest rate environment would be ideal for that business to start seeing wider spreads ? Should we expect any pop from the sale of some of the hedge fund and private equity assets that looks like will close in Q4? And lastly , on Page 38 youâ??re showing the loan-to-value for mortgages and Citi Holdings , and youâ??ve seen a market improvement in those that have loan-to-values over 100% to the point now that your reserves cover basically 100% of those balances when you start looking at those that have greater than 100% and FICOs less than 660. So when youâ??re talking about home prices and the difference it makes , it does make a difference on this particular page in that youâ??ve seen migration in the more stable and better performing buckets . That would still be a positive you could see rolling forward , I would think . Then maybe just a slightly more generic question then . Iâ??m trying to sort of reconcile the comments you made in the beginning , the sort of challenging and uneven operating environment against more of an upbeat backdrop on loan growth , particularly in emerging markets . And just as we go forward , should we think about the kind of growth rates that youâ??ve been able to deliver recently ? Or do you see some things that make you think that could slow down a little ? And those are not marked down; the loan portfolios . Should we expect continued build in unfunded commitment reserves or was this a one-time adjustment ? And then lastly , just bigger picture in terms of the margin on a consolidated basis . You had mentioned â?? expected maybe flat-ish in Q4. But then beyond that , is it fair to assume that there will kind of still be this gradual grind down in terms of the margin on a consolidated basis given the global spread compression that youâ??ve referenced ? And lastly , just to wrap it maybe back to the first question . On this long call of getting to your longer term ROA goal , what would be your view of a normalized interest margin over the cycle to get into that 90%, 110% ROA basis ? Just one quick question on TSO , you indicated that the operating leverage youâ??re expecting H2 to be positive . Could you just give us a sense as to â?? is that vs . H1? Is that year-on-year , and the major drivers there ? Just a question in terms of the composition of the debt that you may issue into the rest of the year . Can you talk about whether it would be â?? kind of the tenor and whether it would be structured notes or institutional deal or even $25 par deal ? Thank you .  Great . Then the last question I have , weâ??ve seen some strong deposit growth at some of your peers , maybe less so for you . Is there any reason for that ?  Three quick questions if I can . First on 23A , you had mentioned this last time in the call , too , as an alternative with respect to moving around liquidity . My question is , with respect to BofA we saw in the past couple of days a lot of blow-back from the market when they moved various things around between the holding company and the bank . Is this something that you still look at or are you reconsidering this as an alternative ? And is there a Plan B beyond 23A ?  Got you . At this point are you putting up any reserves for private investors ? Or is everything just still mainly for GSEs ?  A couple different questions and thanks for doing the call , John and Eric . John , you started off you mentioned the settlement . In there , there is a material amount of consumer relief . Could you talk about the accounting for that ? Do these loans get written down and then go back on performing ? And I think you had another settlement where youâ??ve had another amount of consumer relief as well . How do you look at that in terms of drag on the NIM or just not as productive assets as they could be ? Okay , that makes sense . Thank you . Secondly on OCI , and thank you for the other detail on slide 34. I was hoping to link the two . When Iâ??m looking at slide 17, youâ??ve got a 10-year rate rising by 100BPS and the AOCI â?? Iâ??m sorry , the Basel III Tier 1 effect 13BPS . Iâ??m mapping that to on page 34 what we saw in Q2 2013, where we had a 64 basis point rise . And if Iâ??m reading this right , then in terms of rate and other OCI , that cost 14BPS . So what it appears to me is that youâ??ve got the extra call it 36BPS similar type of impact . So what have you done with the portfolio between then and now to insulate against higher rates ? And have you actually tried to take out more of the risk of spikes as opposed to just a general rise ? And the second question that I have , Ryan went in there . In terms of the SLR , I know that we all had some time to evaluate the finalized version . How do you see it impacting the balance sheet , particularly on the repo side of the trading book ? And also , do you see it impacting various businesses and leading to lower levels of activity and also wider bid/ask spreads , especially for the fixed income side ? Okay . Last one if I can . You brought CFI to the holding company . So Iâ??m guessing that the numbers â?? that was a December 31st event . So Iâ??m guessing the numbers reflect that . Did that help in terms of your levels for unsecured debt at the holding company ? How much was that ? Was that some of the reason for it ? Maybe you could elaborate on that .   Okay , sorry , you did talk a little bit about how the improving housing market is impacting your ability to offload assets out of presumably your North American mortgage portfolio . Can you talk a little bit in the last two to three months as to how you\\'ve seen bid offer spreads change and how close we are to the point where it makes sense from an economic standpoint to offload some of the whole loans in particular where I guess the market\\'s been the most illiquid ?  No , but I would imagine that â?? not that I know anything about their investment objectives , but PIMCO or somebody like that , they run a lot of fixed income money . They\\'re looking for yielding securities . If they\\'re getting inflows , which they probably have been , for all I know , they are looking to put some of that money to work .  There aren\\'t too many people there . In terms of Holdings , did you say $171 billion of Holdings is 5% of total assets ?  Crystal ball , is this a 2013 event though ?  Okay . The $10B in paydowns this quarter that you mentioned , are there specifics to the portfolio that would make fourth quarter more or less , or is $10B a quarter fair enough to think about ?  Okay . Do you have the number that youâ??re looking at ?  Can I ask about the LCR ? You guys have disclosed in the past that you , even under the more stringent criteria , you were ahead I think in Q3 116% LCR . With the new changes , have you had a chance to look at that and where you might be , and does that give you an opportunity to free up some cash ?  Okay , fair enough . And so when we look at your balance sheet down , on a period-end basis down $70B , is that a function of the fact that you used a lot of that cash to pay down debt ? Obviously , you did have some â?? a decline in Citi Holdings as well . But was a good chunk of that used to pay down debt ?  Okay . And then could you quantify the impact that the loan sale had on the Holdings reserve build this quarter ? It sounds like there was a little bit of noise there .  Okay , and then last one . The DCM pipeline , can you maybe give some color on where that stands for you guys ? We had a pretty terrific end of the year . Are we going to be looking at a typical sequential uptick here as we head into the typically seasonally strong Q1?  Thatâ??s fine . And I assume itâ??s 5% for the whole firm . What would it be just for Citicorp ?  Okay . And did you finance any of the sales of the assets in the quarter ?  Sure . Shifting away for a moment to the net interest margin , your interest bearing liability cost in the quarter , when we look at it with and without the FDIC insurance , is higher than some of your competitors . Is there an opportunity to bring those costs down , or is it just because of your global footprint you just need to pay higher costs in markets outside the U .S .?  John C . Gerspach Chief Financial Officer , Citigroup , Inc .And one last question on the balance sheet . Whatâ??s the duration now of the securities portfolio ?  Yes , duration of the securities portfolio in years .  Okay . But a little bit more skewed to dollars , I guess . Okay . On page 30 in the back you outlined the tenders that have been done so far this year . I think that market can be a little confused about rationale behind some of these . Could you give us some of the basic rules of the road that youâ??re using ? What youâ??re looking at in terms of metrics in order to â?? what your valuation is and when you look at going about the tender strategy ? I know you said in the past youâ??ve been opportunistic , but could you put a little more flesh on the bone there ? So if we get a pickup in the overall environment , we get a more favorable interest rate picture , then youâ??ll be able to quickly leverage that . Weâ??ll see the impact of that coming through the bottom line without an offset of a lot of other things that you have to do around regulatory regimes . Maybe the other side of the equation is , Iâ??ve noticed , the growth in international markets has been good on the loan side . The deposit growth has been less impressive . I donâ??t know if thatâ??s something that youâ??re doing consciously or just a product of some of the markets that youâ??re in . I\\'m just curious on ... Okay . And then on the funding side , I believe you had said that funding costs drove the NIM expansion . Maybe give a bit more color on , specifically , what was behind that ?   John C . Gerspach Chief Financial OfficerYeah , I know . I\\'m Sorry if I wasnâ??t â?? I meant is there any geography impact there or anything beyond just shifting away from time deposits ? Okay . And then thinking about your rate shock scenario , can you give any color about what that might look in year two or how you might think about that in year two ? Just trying to think about the benefit from rolling the portfolio into higher yielding securities vs . your expectation for deposit pricing pressure ? Okay . I guess with the â?? so effectively the benefit from rolling into higher rates would probably be largely offset by increasing deposit pricing ? Got it . So the noise is going to depend on what happens to your credit spreads and those of your counterparties and OCI , in other words , rates . And so youâ??re really not going to know about that until the end of the quarter , basically ? I think you put in there that 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve would contribute an additional $1.9B or so to revenue . If the yield curve flattens and the Fed does move rates up next year , but as you notice today , the 10 year is down to about 2.2%. If we donâ??t get the parallel shift , how much of the benefit would you likely see with the front end going up but long end remaining anchored where it is today ? I have a couple of questions . One , on the loan area , business loans , how do you view the current environment ? Is it improving , flat , down ? And what\\'s your outlook for â?? based on your economic intelligence , et cetera , for the next six months ? A deposit question and then a Dodd-Frank question .  So I think this is for you , Eric , and you were talking about this . Could you talk a little bit about how the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney deposits that are being transferred over are captured in the LCR today and what impact that will have on the LCR going forward ?  And then the Dodd-Frank question , there was some new guidance put out I think by the FDIC last week around living wills . And I wondered if you have any perspective for us on how we should be thinking around that .  Okay , thanks . Thatâ??s helpful . And then the other one â?? and I think this is probably just a numbers/geography question .  But as Eric pointed out , your corporate loans were up about 9% y-over-y , which is â?? thatâ??s impressive , frankly . But then if I look at the Securities & Banking lending revenues , they were down about 7% y-over-y . So Iâ??m just trying to square that .  Yes , this is on page 11 of the slide deck for the earnings conference call .  Just two questions . The first question is if you could talk about the impact of the FDIC assessment on CLO holdings , and whether that has changed your appetite to hold CLOs in the bank ? Or your perception around that area , please .  If I can , the next question I had was , can you discuss whether youâ??ve seen any changes in the large corporate deposit area , particularly in the Transaction Services area , with the ending of TAG and corporate deposits generally moving towards the too-big-to-fail bank vs . â?? Iâ??ll just say short-term money market instruments ? And related to that is whether you are more comfortable taking some of these short-term large corporate deposits ?  Hi . I have a quick question and a follow-up .  On the liquidity resources , we saw that the dollar amount has gone down $51B from its peak , but up $16B from year-end . Iâ??m a little surprised at that . Is it just opportunistic issuance in Q1?  And I know you have some guidance around it going down to being flat in 2013. Is that vs . 2012 numbers or vs . Q1 ending numbers ?  I appreciate that . And maybe one last one . Just curious , the AOCI jumped from $12B to $17B . I know spreads widened out a lot , but rates came down . Just curious if you can give us a little color behind the scenes ?  Okay , got you . And second question . The net interest margin and net interest income held in pretty well for you guys , okay , amid a tough interest rate environment . Whatâ??s your outlook for the NII and the NIM if we continue to muddle through a low growth environment here , with low interest rates ?  Okay . Fair enough . One last question on the collateral thatâ??s not netted in your disclosures . Whatâ??s in there ? Is it just not AAA collateral ? Whatâ??s the makeup of that type of collateral ?  Okay . Separately as you think about the long-term debt footprint for the company , there is a lot that youâ??ve talked about running off . Is there some sort of target you would think about long term ?  Okay . Actually , if I could just squeeze in a last one here ? On the deposits , you had very strong growth in U .S . non-interest income , which is obviously the most profitable stuff . Whereâ??s that coming from ? And then the non-U .S . was down , which I donâ??t know if thatâ??s FX or what was driving that ?  Okay . And then , the SAP assets . There werenâ??t any negative marks despite spreads widening out . Were those offset by hedges or was it something else ?  Okay . So you hedge the ratio . So you hedge the denominator , which you spoke about .  Nice work . And then one last question . On a separate topic when you were talking about the international retail , international Consumer Banking , you said that some of the growth was partially offset by spread compression on a year-to-year basis , but you added that the spread compression seems to be abating . I was wondering if you could expand on that and what that might mean for your net interest margin going forward .  Second question . Asia has had noise recently in terms of growth expectations and your Asian consumer loans , the average loans , grew 17% y-over-y . Are you thinking about potentially slowing the pace of growth or being more cautious ?  I was really thinking about the dollars , John . Your full-year NII dollars were $46.8B , but you ended the year with $12B quarter and you have Best Buy now . So is there a reason on a dollar basis that NII wouldnâ??t be higher in 2014 vs . 2013 with the Best Buy portfolio ?  Right . The $12B you did this quarter is a good starting off point on dollars , it seems like .  No , fair , but I think it seems like if we look at your competitors and disclosures , deposit spreads have been pretty stable the last one or two quarters . Just wondering why weâ??re not starting to see a little bit more impact on revenues from volume growth ?  And then just lastly , the steepening of the yield curve , what kind of things are you seeing that might help get the net interest margin to be able to remain with some of the gains that youâ??ve seen here recently ? Are there some favorable either spreads on the trading account or just reinvestment yields being higher that might , if we can keep the yield curve at this level , be positive going into 2014?  Okay . And , John , you guys pointed out you had some success in selling some of those mortgages , I believe , inside of Citi Holdings . What did you receive in term of price vs . your carrying value ?  And QE tapering , does that have an impact in a meaningful way one or the other or higher loan rates ?  I appreciate the call , as always . Two questions if I could . One , thanks for all the detail on the possible impact of the Moodyâ??s downgrade . What Iâ??d like to zero in on is the preparations youâ??ve made with respect to your repo funding base . I take your point very much that people are not going to be just following Moodyâ??s blindly , but as you know some 2a-7 funds and all that are limited in what they can do , assuming that Moodyâ??s makes a mistake and would take the rating down to prime 2. So could you talk a bit about what youâ??ve done to maybe diversify the counterparties in your investor base there ?  Okay . But we wonâ??t look forward to you gathering more deposits or even issuing longer â?? medium and longer-term debt out of these type of entities like an HSBC or Santander ?  Yeah , and on the long-term debt issuance plans , 15 to 20 for 2012, youâ??ve done seven , so really the amount is 15 to 20 minus the seven , just to clarify , right ?  Just a couple of bigger picture questions , perhaps . Eric , you spent some time on Citiâ??s strength in terms of the liquidity coverage ratio and made the obvious point that you all sit above the 100% number and above many of your domestic and international peers . There was some concern when the LCR was first announced that that would have a very negative or upward bias to corporate loan pricing . Iâ??m just curious if thatâ??s been the case so far ? We havenâ??t heard a lot of commentary about it . I wonder if that issue was a little over-hyped when the LCR first came out ?  Okay . Does that impairment test occur every quarter ? Iâ??m asking that in terms of the next tranche of sale , or the call option to buy the 14%?  Can you give us any sense of what you\\'ve learned over the last say four or five months in your discussions with the Fed; in other words , the level of confidence that you have that this qualitative sale is a one-year fix and that it won\\'t extend beyond say going in because I would think that it\\'s what , September something ? Typically the bank ... So I guess , Iâ??m sure you all get the same thing I get from investors and probably your board too â?? of trying to understand what you have at your fingertips in the capital markets business thatâ??s fixed vs . incentive comp and I donâ??t know if you can talk towards that ? But I still want to get towards the timing because I donâ??t have the crystal ball either but the investor base wants to know an action plan ? Can â?? in 2012 do you think weâ??ll see either an improvement in activity or something more material on the structure of the business ?  And then just final quickie on the International Consumer , I know it gets messed up a little bit with FX and whatâ??s constant dollar , but you mentioned a little bit of slowing in Asia investment sales . Is everything else on the International Consumer engine still growing and headed in the right direction in your mind , simple answer ?  And then on net interest income and the margin , this quarter we saw the net interest margin percentage up but your average earning assets down .And in terms of growing net interest income , youâ??ve had some loan growth across the franchise . What will be the key to your ability to grow net interest income this year ?  Got it . And then in your comments you mentioned that mortgage re-default rates were coming in better than you had expected . I guess any kind of hypothesis in terms of whatâ??s driving that ?  I think I was Eric who mentioned that the balance sheet is growing and Corp is growing faster than Holdings is running off . In light of that and some potential changes in how regulation develops over the next couple years , could you comment on your ability to continue to reduce your long-term debt footprint ? Thatâ??s my first question .   Got it . And Iâ??m assuming this is all at the bank level , on the reserves are kept at the bank level . And when I look over at the subordinated debt of $18.8B , thatâ??s primarily bank level as well ?  Okay . Turning to slide 16, your increase in cash , up about $16B , decrease in foreign government outstandings here in the liquidity pool , so it looks like you sold them down . How much was that in European government debt ? Was it peripheral vs . core ? And could you give us an idea of the $120B , how much of that is necessary , for lack of a better term , for in-country liquidity that you need assets against the deposits that you have in country that you want to keep in country vs . how much of that is discretionary buying of European government debt ?  Thanks for all of that . And can we assume of the $120B , that is overwhelmingly the result of deposits in those countries that youâ??re looking to match up with an asset while youâ??re looking for lending or other type of higher yielding opportunities as opposed to a more treasury oriented operation where youâ??re just looking at buying sovereign debt ?  This question is for Eric . On slide 20 on the maturity and issuance page , the YTD issuance of $12.8B , is that all vanilla long-term debt , or does that include some of the structured issuance as well ?  Got you . And then the soft target is $16B for year end ? Is that to assume another $3B to come ? And I think you might have mentioned about potentially another $1B in Q4.  Got you . And then given the state of your debt footprint , looking forward into next year , do we expect the same type of negative net issuance in 2013 that weâ??ve seen the last few years ?  Okay . And then final thing for me , John , in terms of that new supplemental leverage ratio , any thoughts on where you would look in terms of the bank level that will ultimately need to be into the 6% standard ? Okay . Thatâ??s also helpful . Thanks . The AOCI hit was obviously reasonably meaningful in light of a pretty bad increase in long rates and yet it seems like looking at your AFS portfolio , it couldâ??ve been worse . Did you take actions to reduce the impact by repositioning risk or something in sort of mid-quarter ahead of the potential for rates to rise , or was there something else there ? Okay . And then I guess the final question Iâ??ll ask is I think you alluded to trade finance growth , and looking at CTS , it looks like loans grew sequentially by about $13B , if Iâ??m reading this right , and that was about the same growth y-over-y as well as sequentially . So it basically all happened this quarter . Pretty sizable . Anything in particular going on in terms of market share initiatives or something that wouldâ??ve taken those loan balances up so fast ? Okay . And youâ??re suggesting that those might be a little lagged in terms of the recovery because of the quality of them ? have talked about a steepening curve , I think a benefit of a little over $100mm , not very much . Iâ??m just trying to get , vs . your peers thatâ??s on the low end , is it a function of you being shorter in duration in your AFS book ? And if you have that number , that would be great . Or is it just a factor of geographic mix on the balance sheet â?? that youâ??re just less exposed to the U .S . rate curve ? So thanks for the color on the emerging market book . Was just kind of curious if the trends that you saw in the 30-day delinquency rates were any different than the 90-day rates that you gave us ? Sure . Could you tell me what it is , please ? Good . Could you also share with us â?? you mentioned Mexico , those three largest builders . Are those still accruing loans or are any of them in default ? And then just some color on what youâ??re seeing down in Mexico right now .   And has pricing for these assets I think â?? has it improved , or does it continue to improve from what youâ??ve seen in the last six months ? What about blowing out some more of the problem mortgages from Citi Holdings ? You said thatâ??s more a function of home prices . So why not get more aggressive with sales ? Okay . And so the dollar NCLs are going up , but the dollar provision will go up in tune with growth and the dollar increase in NCLs . Okay . Fair enough . And then just finally back home , any thoughts as to potential settlement with Freddie ? I know that Fannie was a bigger buyer of your mortgages over time , but any thoughts about potentially settling with the other side of the GSEs ? Got it . Thatâ??s helpful . And in terms of accelerating the pace of that , youâ??ve previously talked about that the buyer liquidity has been a hurdle just given the size of the portfolio that you need to reduce , but then also youâ??ve brought up how thereâ??s been a difference in lifetime loss estimates more recently . Can you expand on that point a little bit more in terms of what you mean in terms of maybe just the buyer-seller perspective ? Okay . And then in terms of the net interest income , your net interest income dollars fell in Q1. I assume there are some day count pressure , and you mentioned the NIM outlook . Was just wondering , though . Do you hope to grow the net interest income dollars in 2013 given the earning asset expansion youâ??re doing ?  Great; thatâ??s helpful . Turning to Citicorp and looking at Global Consumer in North America , I know itâ??s not a real big thing , but youâ??ve sustained a pretty steady growth rate of commercial markets loan assets . I think youâ??re up almost 20% y-over-y to over $8B . Again , itâ??s not huge when you put it in the context of , say , some of your competitors , but itâ??s a pretty significant growth rate . Is this an area that youâ??ve been targeting for much more significant loan growth , and how are you doing that ?  Quick question on the long-term debt . You guys reduced it about $85B last year . It has certainly been helpful to the margin . With OLA or anything else like that , do you see that slowing this year ? Whatâ??s your outlook on long-term debt ?  Right . So the delinquent loans were down 140BPS in the quarter , linked quarter . So thatâ??s like ...  Okay . And then in the sales of the loans at this point , what kind of discount is necessary to sell those loans at this point , and how would that flow through the P&L ?  Okay . And I think youâ??ve mentioned that youâ??ve got $3B in Other that is basically loans that are available for sale that youâ??re in the process of selling . Is that similar to the $2.8B mix of delinquent and current mortgage ?   John C . Gerspach Chief Financial Officer , Citigroup , Inc .It may be a bit picky , but looking at the International Consumer loan growth , 4% y-over-y is quite a bit lower than we had been seeing , sometimes north of 7%. Can you talk a little bit about what appears to be a declining growth rate in the International Consumer loan business ?  Okay , all right . And you addressed a couple of questions ago about the growth in consumer loans in Asia a little bit; anything else in terms of programs or things that youâ??ve got to show better results in parts of that ? Are there any things that we can talk about ?  Okay . Another question was your cost of funding obviously improved this quarter . and when you look at your deposits and recognizing you have more of a global footprint than the two big banks that reported on Friday , but even still their cost of funding for their deposits is about a third of yours . Do you think we could see yours fall meaningfully over the next 12 to 18 months as the outlook improves for Citigroup ?  Yes , youâ??re at 73BPS and they average about 25BPS .  Okay . And then finally , you mentioned about Asia and the impact that Korea is having on that business . What percentage is Korea as a percentage of the balances , the loan balances , in your Asia portfolio ?  And any idea in terms of the timing or higher rates required as well ?  Okay . And then the last ticky-tack is just on the liquidity . That continues to be pretty strong . Do you have your actual LCR ratio handy ? I think last quarter maybe , it was around 118%.  And do you have a target for that ? Will that drift lower as you deploy excess liquidity , since youâ??re already above the required ?  Right . Right . Okay . No , thatâ??s great . And one last question just on deposit growth . Youâ??ve had very good core deposit growth in Citicorp , but Asia has lagged quite a bit in your international side . Is that simply a function of Korea or is there something else going there more broad-based across Asia thatâ??s limited deposit growth ? Okay . So itâ??s just you guys holding it back ? Quick in Holdings , heard your comments about H2 profitability , which is cool . Iâ??m just curious on the net interest revenue side , net interest revenues have increased last three quarters in a row , but assets , loans and deposits are obviously shrinking with the whole runoff . Just curious on how that works ? Okay . Fair enough . Thought Iâ??d ask . I wanted to ask a question on the potential for the significant deposit movements in the probably foreseeable future at this point when the Fed starts to move short-term rates higher . It seems like the mechanics are going to be different than theyâ??ve been in the past for all the reasons that we all know about . And I think we can say that there is a couple of schools of thought as to what might happen when short-term rates go up . One is deposits had really only shrunk a couple of times in the last century or so . It has always been very marginal , so not to worry .  And then on the other hand , JPMorgan has flagged their view kind of at the other end of the spectrum that maybe this time itâ??s different because the mechanics of what the Fedâ??s going to do will be so different and may require a drain of , theyâ??ve said , maybe $1 trillion of bank deposits . As you think about liquidity planning and your internal stress testing , is there anything that you can share with us about the range of best and worst case deposit growth that you might be thinking about ? Got it . So the follow-up question was going to be how all of this might interact with LCR , but it sounds like what youâ??re saying is that the LCR shouldnâ??t change very much even with the kinds of flows that might be associated with that type of Fed activity because they would probably be low LCR credit deposits anyway . Okay . And then we also have a couple of more things that still need to get resolved . Obviously , itâ??s been in the headlines for a while , things like LIBOR and FX , and so would those also be embedded within this number as well ? And what remains ? I assume FX and LIBOR are the big ones . How should we think about that potential exposure or am I correct in assuming those are the two big remaining legal exposures ? Okay . And last question , if interest rates increased by 100BPS , whatâ??s the benefit to Citigroup today vs . say a quarter ago ? Following up on the comments about the good loan growth in ICG group , you guys had very strong corporate lending revenue growth in the quarter . Can you give some color where the corporate loan growth is coming from ? Shifting gears , moving on to Citi Holdings , you gave us some good color about the pending sales that you have in the pipeline . And I think you said almost $1B of that number comes from mortgage loans . What are you seeing in pricing for the distressed assets in the mortgage area ? Iâ??m assuming it has improved , but by how much ? In view of putting this mortgage problem behind you with the settlement today , is there ever a reason to do a very large bulk sale in Citi Holdings to put it behind you ? Is that ever feasible ? Okay . And then [indiscernible] (80:26) Citi Holdings , I mean end of period loans went down $8B , other assets went down about $300mm , but the total assets and they only went down $3B , whatâ??s the driver of the delta there ? Is it organic growth ? Okay . And then quick question on the asset yield; so you mentioned that the NIM should be stable from here , deposit costs look to have flattened . So can you talk to us about incremental loan yields and incremental securities purchases and then ability to continue to just grow overall balance sheet in terms of NII dollars ? Okay . And just finally from me , you mentioned that the impact of 100BPS higher rate is slightly more at the end of June than it was at the end of March , I noticed that your securities , your investment portfolio is up about 8% y-  over-y , up 4% q-over-q . Can you update us on what the estimated reduction in your tangible common equity would be from a 100 basis point higher rate environment ? Just back on the balance sheet dynamics in a potentially changing rate environment at some point and the deposit velocity question that Guy was getting to earlier , can you just help us understand if you do have a certain level that youâ??ve baked into your modeling , or how you think about the [ph] outcome (95:48) in terms of maybe that â?? I mean over half of the deposits are in fact from the ICG group and a third of those are in North America . So itâ??s still a relatively good contribution of total deposits , how you do think about maybe isolating that component that could be at risk in terms of a reversal , once rates do eventually move higher ? So it certainly is a risk . The subordinated holding company debt would be junk rated if they were to remove a notch of systemic uplift . And Iâ??m curious what kind of contingency plans , or have you run through a series of ideas of what or how you would mitigate that risk ?  A couple of quick questions from the slides . First , on slide 9 when you talked about long-term debt outstanding , weâ??ve had â?? you had planned to do $20B in issuance this year . So far done $13B , so thatâ??s $7B outstanding . With the reduction in long-term debt outstanding of $16B between now and the end of the year that leaves me down $23B net . Where is that going to come from ?  Okay . You had mentioned outflows with MSSB , and that eventually youâ??ll be making them up with other customer deposits . But in the meantime , have â?? I know earlier this year , we saw a few banks issue senior debt at the bank level . Is that something that youâ??ve looked at and might include in part of the funding mix ? And what are the pros and cons of that ?  Okay . One last very quickie is the repurchase claims were down 25%. Do you feel like youâ??ve been through most of the pipeline ? Itâ??s â?? definitely itâ??s a standout vs . your peers . Iâ??m just curious on how you feel on that ?  Hi , John . Just on the deposits , you guys were up $30B on a period-end basis sequentially . Can you talk about the drivers if you think that was sort of end of the quarter issue or if that\\'s pretty sticky and if that is somewhat sustainable , can we expect to see the long-term debt footprint come down or accelerate given that deposit growth which helps your margin . I know you dont like to talk about your margin , but your margin was up this quarter . So maybe you can talk about that interaction .  Okay , fair . And should we â?? could you disclose or give us the benefit from the trust preferred buyback on the margin ? And if we can expect to see at least some additional benefit as youâ??ve pulled back your long-term debt footprint ?  Thanks for taking the question . Quick one first on the repo costs , and we were just sort of talking about the funding costs , John , and I know you mentioned about deposit costs coming down . But it also looked like the repo line in your average balance sheet dropped pretty significantly . Was that due to some sort of change in the funding portfolio there; reduction in tenor or something like that ?   Yeah , sounds like it . While weâ??re on LCL , taking a slightly different tact and when you think about the negative carry that you guys have there , the negative spread , how much rate sensitivity is there in that LCL business ? And I know that I think in your disclosures you indicate that about a third of your consumer loans float . How many of those are in LCL ? And how much of a function of the negative spread might be due to low interest rates ?  Just on the funding cost side rather than the asset side ?  Okay . So the second lien isnâ??t a big factor there either floating ? Okay . Fair enough . And then last one for me . On the LCL business , of the second lien mortgages , the HELOCs , how many of those have started to amortize at this point ? Is there any sense we can get on that front ?  Great . Thanks . Just on a different topic , John , you did say again that you expected kind of slower drawdown of the assets out of Citi Holdings and yet by the same token you also referenced that the Mortgage business , to the extent  that thereâ??s improvement in the housing market , you could start to accelerate sales and use the reserve like you did a little bit of this quarter . Could you kind of â?? I mean , how would that take shape in terms of what it might mean for the balances in the Local Lending business ?  Just a follow up on some of the NIM discussion . Sorry if I missed it , but did you provide an outlook for the net interest margin from here ?  And , specifically within your securities portfolio , again thinking we â?? you donâ??t have a lot of agency RMBS , as you look across all the other asset classes that youâ??ve been buying , itâ??s a little hard for us to track externally . Have you seen as much spread compression there in terms of your reinvestment rates , what they are now vs . what they were , say , in Q2?  Okay . Just switching gears here; weâ??re a couple of quarters into HARP . I think there has been some changes to the FHA refi fees . As you think about that $95B of mortgages you have , and I realize some of thatâ??s second lien , but are there any that could be HARPed or refied ? Do you literally go loan-by-loan and proactively try and refi or have you done that or think about doing that ?  And , do you have any sense of how much of the $60B of first could be HARPed ? Obviously , it takes time to figure it out and reach to people .  Right , okay . And , then separately on the NIM outlook that you discussed a little bit agoâ?¦.  â?¦clearly , one of the benefits of the NIM that you have this quarter was the reduction in your long-term debt costs , right ?  Right . So , I think youâ??ve got about $25B in long-term debt coming due over the next couple of years . Any color on how much of that debt youâ??ll be refiing vs . rolling off ?  And then last question , as it relates to LIBOR investigation , last quarter you seem pretty fine with the question . When do you think youâ??ll hear about the LIBOR investigation ? How do you feel today ?  Okay , John , just to clarify one piece of the outlook . The net interest margin you indicated that might be down a few basis points in Q2, is that for NII dollars as well ? Just kind of wondering whatâ??s driving that outlook as it would seem that day count and seasonality in cards would get better from Q1 as we move forward in terms of net interest income dollars ? Is that on dollars as well , John , if we think about net interest income dollars ? And is there a benefit from day count in cards that would overwhelm that or is that net out ? Thank you . I had to jump off the call so I apologize if youâ??ve already addressed this . But on the debt gain that you had in Citi Holdings , what was the dollar amount of that amount â?? for that transaction ? John , Eric , good morning . Thanks again for the presentation . Iâ??ve got two questions . Now one of them , frankly , is a doomsday scenario , but Iâ??m sure that you guys probably have contingency planning . If things in Washington donâ??t move ahead , if we were to get a government default for whatever period of time , what impact , if any , do you think there might be on the availability of repo funding ? Thatâ??s the first question .  Okay , thanks . Thatâ??s helpful . And believe me; I appreciate the [ph] honesty (37:05). I just wanted to get your thinking on that . And then the other matter is really just a clarification . And that is with respect to the Section 23 interest affiliate lending . So you all certainly have the right to do that assuming thatâ??s appropriately collateralized . I guess the only question is there would be no issues with your regulators if you had to resort to that ?  Okay , fair enough . The second one is on slide 13, and again , sorry if Iâ??m covering old ground on this one . But just to clarify , the $96B in the bank stack , if my color coding is correct , that corresponds to long-term debt . I guess I  just wanted to confirm that that is actually senior unsecured , or does that include what shows up in the Ks as other long-term debt , like FHLB advances ?  Okay , thatâ??s very good . Thank you . And then finally , Iâ??m just wondering . I guess there has been some scratching of heads around â?? not yours particularly , but your competitorsâ?? costs in repo funding . I just wondered if from your involvement in the market if youâ??ve seen any movements to increase tenor of any repo facilities , or any particular movements in collateral or anything of note that youâ??ve seen as a participant in the repo markets .  Okay . Over the life of all of that ? Over the assets ?  Okay . Great . And then how would we think about the corresponding sale of deposits to MSSB ? What are the prices generally that are tied to brokered deposits and brokered accounts ? And how much of that is a gain ?  Okay . Is it right though to think that maybe those sales or deposits could be a somewhat meaningful portion ? Or unlikely to be so ?  Quick question on the deposits . You guys were up , on a period-end basis anyway , $40B , a lot of it internationally and in the institutional side . Can you â?? I wouldâ??ve thought you wouldâ??ve seen outflows after the big flight to safety trade in Q4. So whatâ??s driving that ? Was there anything episodic about the end of the quarter ? Or was that just good sort of new business wins ?  Got it . So itâ??s more just the normal investments in the business as opposed to ...  Yeah , you guys have done a good job keeping it around that 288 to 290. Can you give us some color on what you see going as we move forward ?  A couple of quick questions . One , just first of all , John , in terms of the recent data weâ??ve heard coming out of Asia and China specifically in terms of the potential slowing of growth there , has that presented you any concerns about some of your expectations for revenue and loan growth coming out of your Asian platform ?  One on the liquidity . You indicated a huge amount of liquidity 26% or so of assets . Could you give us a sense as to how much you could drive that down if you had all the lending , high quality lending , that you could do out there ?  Sure . And that is in part going to be a function of the LCL book coming down as well because Iâ??m assuming youâ??re having to hold liquidity against that portfolio ? Is that right or no ?  Sure . Iâ??m just â?? okay . Then on LCL , are you in the process of considering the buy-to-rent program that many others are ? In other words , pulling together some of the properties that you have for sale to private equity ? Or  alternatively renting some of the homes that you have right now as per the recent Fed rulings that allows banks to do that ?  And then last unrelated would be EMEA loans are up a little bit the way Iâ??m looking at it from Q4. Does that make sense to be expanding those loans ? And are you simply being opportunistic because others are retreating ? Or whatâ??s happening there ?  But we donâ??t know what it was last year , so we donâ??t know the absolute number ?  So should we think that thatâ??s a sort of negative carry going forward ? Or was that somewhat anomalous , but we should obviously take into account that with assets lower , net interest income will be lower no matter what ? Whatâ??s the best way to look at it ?  Well , I would think it would matter , but we never really get a lot of color on the degree to which it reduced robo-signing issues and the like .  Okay . And then the last question on the net interest margin at the top of the house , I think you talked a little bit about NII at Holdings . How do you see the â?? what are the puts and takes for your NIM and net interest income , all in , at Citicorp and Citigroup for the next couple quarters ?  Okay . Is the magnitude of the roll-off of long-term debt similar going forward to what we saw this quarter ?  Okay . And then , in terms of the interest earning assets , thereâ??s a little bit of loan growth net and then also some , looks like increasing in liquidity still; is that preparing for regulatory , or is that just deposit inflows and nothing else to do with the money ?  Okay . And then separately , just to follow up on , I think , Johnâ??s question about the margin and the net interest income dollars going forward . If the NIM is relatively stable from here , obviously the positive loan growth that you saw this quarter is very good , and it sounds like itâ??s sustainable . So should we expect net interest income dollars to continue to rise off of Q2 level ?  Okay . But I guess as we think about loan growth overall , absent large asset sales out of Citi Holdings , it seems like you should be able to generate net loan growth for the overall company from here .  Do you guys feel that you have turned the corner in terms of building the portfolio ? Obviously the end of period loans in this area grew this quarter vs . Q1. Do you think youâ??re now on a growth trajectory for this business ?  Okay . Fair enough . You mean Holdings is there , but itâ??s running off , right ? But even if you include the increased inflation on Holdings it would still â?? it would cut the effect in half , but itâ??s still noticeable . Okay . Thank you .   Okay . So after collateral , and what else would be included in risk management ?  A couple of questions as well , please . First of all , I donâ??t believe I found this in the equity call or in our disclosure , but is it possible to get your nonperforming assets , not loans but assets , across the group including OREO ?  Just one question . Iâ??m wondering whether you can quantify the net stable funding ratio number and also in that regard are you more likely to issue more 30-year debt or even to do it preferred , just given where yields are so low and the shrinkage in the TruPS overall market ? Thank you .  I think this is a quick one . Regarding your deposit composition , and the increase in non-interest-bearing deposits as you laid out in your supplement , what are your expectations around the elimination of the unlimited insurance at the end of this year and do you expect to see any significant change in the composition you lay out in the presentation ?  You recently did a securitization of some of the OneMain assets and how is that helpful , what does that do for you in the long run getting rid of some of these assets ? On that note , another question that\\'s come up , just can you comment on the strategy in terms of U .S . retail ? What\\'s the status of your deposit franchise ? What are the differentiating characteristics on that ? And what are your plans for that over the next couple of years , especially as you think about rates rising potentially and hopefully some day in the U .S .? You are clearly very successful in the wind-down of assets that started when you took over Holdings . And when you take a look at SAP assets and LCL assets , the decline rate quarter-over-quarter has slowed here in 2012. Do you think there\\'s something that can be done to reverse that ? And after you moved on from running Holdings , did the strategy to remove assets change at all ?  Okay , how about I\\'ll ask in a different way , do you see any need to change Citi\\'s growth focus as it\\'s been laid out in the past couple of years ?  Okay , and I guess we\\'ll hear more potentially as you get your arms around this in next year or early next year ?  Second question , shifting gears a little bit: now that we see that cash is included in the SLR and Citigroup has always been a very liquid and big holder of cash , are you looking at that any differently ? I know when we look at balance sheet and look at your liquid assets , we get a point in time I know weâ??re going to go to an average daily balance . So maybe you could talk about how that varies and how you look at cash going forward ?  Dave MacGown asked part of the question that I had in mind , and related to the expected NPR on wholesale short-term funding , I know itâ??s early to say without knowing what the NPR is , but how will it impact your funding strategy and the funding plans for the company ?  And from the clientâ??s perspective I think one of the concerns we have is how will it impact market liquidity ?  A question on the net interest revenue , not necessarily the margin percentage but the net interest revenue per day that you showed on the slide , which shows a pretty nice trend of modest growth over the last eight quarters . It looks like that metric has not historically had a second quarter dip , so I know that you mentioned that the NIM percentage may dip in second quarter due to some seasonal dividend payments that come up , but does that actually impact the NII dollars ? Or is that dividend issue just kind of a NIM percentage issue ?  Okay . Thatâ??s fair . So you donâ??t have a predetermined view on net interest revenue going forward on the near-term basis . You think over time , as the balance sheet grows you expect it to improve but no predetermined view for Q2 on that .  Okay . Got it . Thatâ??s helpful . And then on the net interest income and the net interest margin , the margin down 9BPS is a little more than you had thought it might be a few months ago . What were the drivers of that and what kind of outlook might you have on the margin and net interest income potential ?   Okay . And that includes the benefit of TruPS redemptions and any other actions around the debt footprint that youâ??ve talked about ?  Okay . And , then just lastly on the LIBOR , both you and JPMorgan have said you can\\'t really comment on it but both of you have also said donâ??t assume that all banks are the same , which I think some people are interpreting as a positive that you might be less exposed . So , I will ask again if there is anything more that you can say , and if not , when will investors and analysts have a better sense of whatâ??s going on , the timeline if you could offer anything there ?  Do you think that â?? I hate to say this is a new norm , but if rates stay where they are as the Fed has suggested they want to see through the end of 2014 that â?? we donâ??t know what volumes will be , of course , but do you think the spreads could actually stay at these unusually high levels for as long a period of time ?  Okay . And so , at this point youâ??re not thinking necessarily any [ph] necessarily (93:42) change near term in terms of the pace , what weâ??ve been seeing the last couple of quarters ?  No , I think thatâ??s a fair point . And , I just was more saying I think the longer-term debt has widened a bit over the last couple of months and thatâ??s what I was more focused on in the short-term cash spreads .  Okay , great . And , then in terms of the margin outlook that was helpful to hear that stable from where we are today to 81-ish . But , just on the NII , maybe I missed it; should spread income also hold up , or should there still be a natural drift lower because of the run-off portfolio lower for longer ? How should we think about that ?  Couple of quick questions . First , youâ??ve given a lot of detail on maturity and issuance of long-term debt . So far this year you accessed the market with $2.5B of a five-year and $1B of a 30-year . Could you talk to us about how you look at this debt issuance and some of the metrics you use ? Are you looking at weighted average maturity ? How do you look at that vs . the interest rate background vs . the need to match liabilities with assets ?  So are you at about five years now ? And you would look to move it to seven years given the overall level of interest rates ?  Okay . And thatâ??s fair , John . I realize this is litigation , so one never knows . Now with respect to private label MBS litigation from other parties , I hunted around the 10-Q a little bit , and there was a reference to one particular litigation , New Jersey Carpenters Health Fund , or something like that , which referred to an original purchase amount of $8B in mortgages . And so I guess my question is , is that the only one out there ? Or are there other relevant disputes right now ? And if so what is the sort of total amount of outstanding private-label mortgage-backed securities that Citi sold that are involved in litigation ?  Thanks , guys . So we\\'ve seen two quarters where core revenues felt like they came in a bit better than expected , not only for you , but for the industry . It feels like activity may be stabilizing , hopefully improving . But when we look at the liquidity reserve , it\\'s still seems pretty high . I think in the past , you said when the environment gets better , you could see that trend down . So I guess basically , does that relationship still stand ? Do you sense any improvement , or are there still enough regulatory uncertainties on the liquidity and funding side to remain ultraconservative ?  Okay . And then I guess you touched on this , but the liquidity levels remain still at the highs . The environment is more stable at this point . What do you look for to bring that down , if you have any plans to ?  Hey , one nitpicky question . But on Investing & Lending on the debt side , can you give us a sense as to realized vs . unrealized ?  On the equity side , the realized vs . unrealized ? Is that mostly unrealized ? Is that fair ?  Okay . Maybe just on liquidity , can you give us any thoughts on with the new LCR [Liquidity Coverage Ratio] ratio language , how you guys feel youâ??re positioned for the LCR ?  The assets are down 2% quarter over quarter . Whatâ??s happening there and should we extrapolate that downsizing of the balance sheet ?  Because the Fed wants you to report the lower of the two , right ? I have two questions . One I think is pretty straightforward , the other perhaps a little bit less so . So first on the bank , and I did listen to your comments on the earnings call , but what are your plans for growing the bank over time from letâ??s say basically about $60B in deposits ? There was $100B figure thrown out there , we can talk about that , but also your plans for growing the corporate loan book ? I think the commitments are around $70B of commitments . What are your thoughts about that over time ?  I think that all of us on the fixed income side find this very helpful . Just to follow-up on , first of all on your comments on slide 7, on the excess liquidity , Liz youâ??d said that thereâ??s a surplus over the requirements here . Could you talk about how much that surplus is as a multiple of what the requirements are ? How that changes over time ? Because the figure seems to keep â?? to be pretty constant over the past several quarters but thereâ??s obviously some variation there in the requirement .   Quick question on the deposit level of the bank , it has grown a lot , as you noted in the slide deck . Where do you think it actually ultimately ends up ? Is it â?? is this something we should see growing by another 100% over the next year or two ? Or is this kind of the right size at this point ?  Okay . And then you mentioned that you would be opportunistic on unsecured funding for H2. I was wondering , is there a particular kind of scope that you would think would fit you well if market conditions present â?? is it in the $5-ish billion or $10-ish billion or $20B range ? Or is â?? could be a bit more â?? give maybe a bit more information on that ?  Right . And then one last question on the liquidity portfolio , $174B , when you say itâ??s convertible into cash in a matter of days so this portfolio is somewhere in the high 90â??s comprised of Treasuries or GSE type , a little more detail maybe on the liquidity portfolio ?  I just wanted to echo Daveâ??s comments as well , we really appreciate the call and the color . And actually , Dave asked one of my questions so Iâ??m just going to have one final one for Liz . Now when you were talking about your model liquidity model that you use for allocating your liquidity pool among the subs , I was just wondering if itâ??s â?? if it , I know you specified that it has to do with kind pre-funding or for anticipating funding but does it also involve some kind of value at risk estimates ? And what Iâ??m trying to get at is , to an earlier question about the flow between subsidiaries and the ability to move that liquidity pool among subsidiaries , I was just wondering how much value at risk calculation goes into that ?  Great . And then just to drill down a little bit more into the bank and maybe on the asset side , the trading assets youâ??ve got there , could you provide some more color about that ? How much is derivatives ? How much is securities ?  And then I guess my other question is just in terms of the lending that youâ??re pursuing in GS Bank , what sort of loans youâ??re targeting there ?  And so on the private banking side , is that providing loans to people for margin loans ? Or is it more sort of mortgages ?  And one last one , if I could . Just looking at excess liquidity . Listening to the equity call , the view of the equity community may be that youâ??re carrying too much excess liquidity at this point , and itâ??s a drag on earnings . For those of us in fixed income , we greatly appreciate the size and how thatâ??s managed .  As the environment changes or as your thinking changes , is there a sweet spot that youâ??re looking at numerically or is there a formula where you think you can make both the equity community and your fixed-income investors happy at the same time ?  Just a quick question , please , about deposits . Have you seen any outflows this year after the expiry of the FDICâ??s TAG program ?  A couple questions . I think the first one is probably for Liz and itâ??s around liquidity . This might be a nomenclature question , but I interpret from your slide 9 that your global core excess is funded with long-term debt , deposits and equity , but on your slide 12 you make reference to the non-GCE funding book . I want to make sure we understand precisely how the GCE is funded , and thatâ??s particularly important as we gear up for something perhaps this year on capital charges for secured financing transactions from the Fed .  And related to that , do you have any early comments on how some of the things that , Liz , youâ??ve just talked about on funding and liquidity management might change in light of what we expect to come out of the Fed on SFP ? For example , might it imply a higher mix of long-term debt as part of the funding mechanism in liquidity management ?  Thatâ??s fine , I appreciate that . And finally for Liz , this is my last one , you said something really interesting about moving away from the traditional U .S . money market lenders and to â?? directly to global corporate . So the global corporates , the way I understand it works , global corporates give cash to money market funds and then they go find paper to invest in , and it seems like youâ??re , in effect , bypassing the middleman . Do I have this correct ? And can you just maybe elaborate on your all motivations for this ? Because it seems very interesting .  Thanks for the commentary on slide 13 regarding issuance being likely to track maturities but with the caveat that Goldman is going to revisit the targets frequently depending on the size and composition of the balance sheet . Just looking at the balance sheet size over the last â?? call it five years , itâ??s been plus minus $900B to $950B . Could you maybe give us some context in terms of what factors might drive that to grow at some point , or do you think itâ??s really largely range bound ?  Okay . So just given the regulatory path , $20B of maturities and issuance a year is a pretty reasonable base case ?  Okay , thatâ??s helpful . And then I guess the no big change is just a function of markets keep moving higher , so your assets grow with it . So you sell some , but it goes off . Okay , I got that . And then on the balance sheet freeing up that you did , the relatively low ROA assets that are not necessarily helping clients as much , I mean , I would think that youâ??re doing that in part ahead of this significant M&A calendar that typically comes with lines of credit , bridge loans , et cetera . Is that fair ? Right . Okay . And so part of thatâ??s already in the footings . Got it . As it relates to loan growth , what are your priorities for growing loans and do you think that loan growth in the industry is accelerating ? Can you just elaborate on your comment ? You said loan growth does not seem to be accelerating ? Itâ??s just a [ph] bounce off (42:55)... Just a quick follow up maybe just on the balance sheet question . It was very helpful you talked about the matchbook coming down $25B , but the total balance sheet down $55B . Can you give any color on the other $30B ? But just expanding on that , I mean , just the fact that potentially , they were maybe crowding out players in the market and to the extent that doesnâ??t exist anymore , youâ??re not seeing that maybe as a little bit of a boost to the business post-October or as we get closer to the deadline where theyâ??re done ? But would that target move lower now , now that youâ??re doing these balance sheet actions ? Okay . Okay . And then , sorry , how much could you reduce your balance sheet by if you reduced your compression traits to your SLA ? So investment lending continues to do great , and the future be what it is with this quarter . But Iâ??m just curious , you mentioned the good IPO market obviously , but if you could break down maybe on the equity side , what was realized gains vs . marks and then if weâ??ve seen any big changes in the composition of the overall asset base between equity debt and lending assets . I just want to follow-up on the question on Investing & Lending . Debt revenues in particular were robust this quarter , and stands out given the backdrop for credits were choppy in the quarter . You mentioned asset sales . I would appreciate any color on how much asset sales drove this quarterâ??s revenues . And more broadly , any color on the long-term drivers of the debt line ? Okay . And weâ??ll probably get it in the 10-Q , but do you have the level of direct investments now and maybe how that compares to a year or two years ago , just to show how quickly thatâ??s been ramping ? So that aside then , maybe can give us a sense for what is the impact on that business of some of the changes that you made with respect to bringing down the balance sheet in Q2? And when you add all of that up , and going back also to the pricing of security services and other securities financing transactions , are you in real-time seeing that the scarcity value of balance sheet is driving re-pricing that would be favorably to you presumably ? Following up on one of Jimâ??s questions there . So your LCR in excess of the minimum , is that the fully phased in minimum or the first minimum threshold of 80%? And then you mentioned on the debt underwriting , the regulatory pressure on leverage lending and maybe some impact there . Does that feel a little bit more permanent as you move forward , given the stance that weâ??ve seen , talked about openly by the regulators ? Hey , just a quick question , when you look at some of the regulations coming down the road here , wholesale funding surcharge being one of them and the NSFR , both of those would benefit from a greater level of deposit funding on the balance sheet [indiscernible] (1:04:12). Are you thinking about growing deposits currently , and if you are , kind of , are you thinking about it organically or through acquisition or are you just not even thinking about it at all ? The more challenging conditions that you spoke to in the back half of the quarter with respect to client risk appetite and inventory management -- was hoping you could just comment . Have those difficult conditions persisted as weâ??ve rebased it at new higher levels of U .S . benchmark rates , or have they abated a bit ?   And that\\'s where I was hoping to go next . It feels like weâ??ve been talking for a couple years about this wall of client liquidity that\\'s out there and the near-zero interest rates creating more of a one-way market in certain clusters like credit and mortgages . Have we seen enough of a move , in your mind , to see more two-way flow in some of these businesses that weâ??ve been hoping for ? I guess one , just maybe bouncing off a couple things Howard was asking , so the market quality in rates and credit -- would you characterize that as more normalized now in July ? It sounds like in June that lack of dealer liquidity provision maybe contributed somewhat to the gapping in spreads . And I\\'m wondering if that\\'s part of the new world we live in now with the new regulatory environment , where asset prices move and dealers are less apt to take positional risk . Maybe lastly , liquidity levels continue to run high . And again , it\\'s early days in thinking about leverage ratios and how some of those liquidity assets get calculated into that . Does that change your thinking about how much liquidity you want to run with ? A follow-up question to your comments that the pipelines were relatively stable vs . the end of last quarter . And I know itâ??s early in the quarter here , but just any thoughts in terms of a change in the mix ? I think a lot of people view that if rates increase like the way they did , thatâ??s when debt issuance would dry up . As we know , thatâ??s not always the case . Has there been any change in the mix of the pipeline , maybe even within the debt business a mix change in terms of away from high yield in terms of like away from high yield towards certain things ? You mentioned some inventory management in June . Can you give us some sense of what marks were involved ? Pretty comfortable . Now last follow-up on that because it goes â?? someone said by 2018 youâ??ll get there or by 2015, or youâ??ll pass the Fed stress test , or will you be able to buy back shares as quickly as youâ??ve done ? Thatâ??s really what it comes down to , I think . Just a couple of quickies , I think . Your long-term unsecured debt , at least according to the press release , is down roughly $5B quarter-to-quarter . How are you thinking about debt levels going forward , and have you changed your thinking at all on OLA and how that will affect your debt balance going forward ? The flows generally focused in lower yielding fixed income assets or slightly higher yielding fixed income assets ? Okay . And then just secondarily , Q1 balance â?? quarter end balances for the GCE were down a little bit and granted maybe Iâ??m making too much of this . But I guess Iâ??m just curious as to why those were down as you ended the quarter given that weâ??ve heard from a number of clients that they were increasing their liquidity as a result of some of the macro issues in DC ? No , I understood . Last question on this , then . Are the positions that you had sold or are they hedged ? Okay . Thank you for that for that , Harvey . We just talked about rising rates on tapering , but is this with sort of liquidity as well , which I think was one of the great fears that weâ??ve just seen and that does suggest the need to realign the business . And I think what youâ??re saying is that youâ??ll just keep an eye on that and you have no plans at the moment to do that in respect of something that hasnâ??t actually started , albeit it will keep going for a long time once tapering starts ? Okay . And then in Investing & Lending , can you just remind us a bit on the debt securities ? However you can talk about a composition of investments ? Is this mostly distressed debt , structured ? Whatâ??s in this mostly ?   So you could hedge if you wanted to ? Thereâ??s no prescription keeping you from hedging ?  And if you look at the cash funding market against the CDS spreads that youâ??re seeing , how do they differ ?   Two quick questions , one is , given the widening of your cash spreads , which I realize has not been quite as volatile as your CDS spreads , and your desire to maintain liquidity , have you thought about repurchasing some of the debt that trades currently in the market ?  Could you remind us how much youâ??ve got maturing before the end of the year ?  And you still â?? there is a decent private component to it so I am assuming that there are still some big liquidity discounts used on the private positions ?  Okay . Because it just looks like maybe there wasnâ??t as much this past quarter as an average wouldâ??ve suggested . Is that fair or you wouldâ?¦?  Got it . Okay . Just a final question . I think last quarter you helped us understand what the ROE impact was of maintaining the kind of global core excess that you have . Can you give us a sense for what the liquidity drag is at this point ?  I would have thought it would have been a better hedge outcome for you if you assured that .  Okay . And last one just on the Investing and Lending business . You guys provide that sensitivity in the Q . But do you have any color in terms of the portfolio percent that is public vs . private ? Just in terms of trying to get a sense in the future . Obviously itâ??s a challenge . But just the portion thatâ??s going to be more based on either DCF models and kind of long-term views vs . the public markets .  Is that still the case ? Because you say the first few days are going better in Q3.  Okay . So , thatâ??s how much you have allocated now ?  Could I just come back to that correlation ? But some banks seem to be saying theyâ??re actually taking action to reduce their business significantly and take away legacy assets just to downsize it in advance .   Okay . And then Iâ??m just wondering about the volatility in the index and whether thereâ??s a factor in terms of how one â?? because it moved so quickly , some of the pricing moved so quickly towards the end of the quarter .  No worries . On Investing & Lending , anything you can tell us on realized vs . unrealized ? I heard your comments about private equity on the equity line , but just curious on whatâ??s realized vs . unrealized .  Just , I guess , on your liquidity levels , theyâ??re still running kind of right up around record levels and just thinking through the still cautious approach to managing balance sheet and capital , it feels â?? is this level something that over time comes down meaningfully ? Or are we going to see a sort of permanently higher level of liquidity ? I mean , I assume this is a peak level , but what kind of range relative to where you used to run , which I think was like a quarter and a half of this , do you think you may eventually get back to ?  Gotcha . Gotcha . Second question , I picked up that you mentioned there was maybe some improvement throughout the quarter , but I guess it wasnâ??t that significant in terms of activity levels coming in vs . leaving the  quarter . Any particular products , it sounds like mortgages was one of them , where there was a noticeable improvement vs . coming into the quarter vs . leaving ?  Okay , and then what about funding ? Does it help at all with the funding side ?  I just wanted to follow up on the article Iâ??m reading in the Wall Street Journal , Goldman Builds Private Bank , sets a target for $100B in additional loans . Can you describe what youâ??re doing in the private banking area and with regard to targets for loans ?  Well , okay . So no comments on LIBOR at this point ?  And then forgive me if youâ??ve already mentioned this , but I jumped on the call just a couple of minutes late . Any material changes to your stated exposures to the GIIPS countries in Q2 relative to what youâ??ve put out for Q1?  Okay . Another small thing , book was down a drop in the quarter , function of higher share count even though you bought back . Is that a stock issuance thing ?  Okay , cool . And then maybe one last one , David . Funding costs right now , I mean you guys have been able to get off some reasonable deals all in , especially some of the 50-year paper , but funding costs all in for the industry are just a lot higher . How do you balance knowing what to issue now vs . hanging out and what happens if funding costs stay here as that rolls through the balance sheet ? Is that a big impact ?  Couple questions , one , just kind of housekeeping issue but itâ??s on the Investing and Lending segment so the debt marks had the impact of a hedge . And I guess I just wanted to understand how much the hedge impacted the debt section of the I&L both this quarter and last quarter ?  So youâ??ve had the best loan syndications in the industry I guess in about a couple decades . Is some of that activity reflecting a swap from the capital markets to loans ? Or why are you seeing that ?  The best loan syndications in the industry in two decades , so my question is , are you seeing that in less fixed income or bond issuance ? Are some of those bonds going to loans ? Or do you have any color on that ?  And my question is; are you seeing activity move from capital markets back to loans ?  Well if you feel a teeny bit better about Europe , would that mean youâ??d lean a little bit more towards buy-backs ?  Okay . Oh and just lastly on VaR , the interest rate VaR . You noted that that was up because volatility was up a lot . Did you actually reduce risk in interest rates ? Or did you increase VaR adjusted in the quarter ?  Yes , hi , good morning . Doug , there seems to be a big build-up in liquidity on the balance sheet . You mentioned that . Can you give a little color on that ? Is being driven by the lack of investment options amid low rates or is it being driven by the new regulatory rules that might be coming out around liquidity ?  And any color on the net interest margin this quarter ? Was that the big driver of the decline sequentially in net interest margin this quarter ?  And is there any â?? do you have any outlook on the net interest margin or net interest income , Doug ?  Okay . And the other question is going back to the NIM question again , you know , with rates staying here and I think you said a little bit earlier in the call that you expect modest declines in NIM , at what point do you just let the balance sheet start to roll down ? I mean , whatâ??s that sacrifice ? Because if you grow your balance sheet , it seems that youâ??re going to have more NIM pressure . Just let it roll off with rates at these levels ?  Let me shift gears . Syndicated lending , how much did that contribute to the growth in wholesale loans , and what were your syndicated lending fees this quarter ? And whatâ??s your view on the market overall ? It seems like itâ??s really growing quickly .  And lastly what was the average price where you bought back stock last quarter ?  I guess first following up on the net interest margin and net interest income dollars . Obviously the NIM percent was down a fair amount this quarter , but the net interest income dollars was down a little less than $100mm , and with the balance sheet starting to grow from here , do we see continued stabilization and then some growth in the back half of the year in the dollars ?  Okay . And then just separately , as we think about the macro environment and a lot of us have been waiting for higher rates and more activity overall and hopefully itâ??s going to come but itâ??s hard to have too much confidence in that any time soon , is there kind of a plan B in maybe if the investment spend and card , retail , asset management , the deposit pricing ? Just what are some of the contingency plans that you have if weâ??re stuck with low rates for a few more years and weâ??re just kind of hobbling along with 2%, 2.5% growth ?  Okay . Fair enough . And on the deposit side , you had a big improvement I think $50B or so sequentially on average deposits . Most of that seemed to be in TSS . Is that a reflection of a flight to safety given the macro concerns out there ? And if so , does that continue into July ?  Hi . I have three questions , please . The first is probably the broadest one , which is youâ??re stuck with higher capital , you may not like it but youâ??re stuck with it . One thing you can cut expenses or you can re-price . So can you talk about across the businesses and maybe particularly in investment banking what youâ??re doing in terms of re-pricing and how you manage that with competition ?  But you need to . And I know just anecdotally youâ??re re-pricing some of your products . Are we not even in stage 1 yet , is what youâ??re saying ?   Okay . But even from a cost structure basis to offset that , thereâ??s got to be re-pricing ?  Good morning . Two quick questions . Just in terms of the home lending portfolio , we saw that drop about $30B y-over-y , and thatâ??s in line with the outlook that you had given . Any update on the pace that we can expect that portfolio to continue to shrink over the next year or two ? That would be the first question .  Forever . I guess maybe thatâ??s what Iâ??m looking for . Any idea on when you think that might start to stabilize ? Obviously not in the near term , but ...  Thank you . Good morning . Can you guys share some color on the asset yields ? In your loan portfolio , we have been hearing anecdotal evidence that competition is very , very aggressive . Did you guys see that this quarter as the yields came down sequentially to 5.36% from 5.62%?  Douglas L . Braunstein Chief Financial Officer , JPMorgan Chase & Co ., Inc .Yeah , and then just one last litigation question , the FHA was taking a look at some things that accompanied Deutsche Bank had bought regarding the quality of the loans . Are you â?? might you be involved in that investigation at some point ?  I have to admit , Iâ??m one of those nerds that looks at the Fedâ??s H .8 data every Friday afternoon and on the total loan volumes , and just systemically they look like theyâ??re turning around . You know , for most of the last 18 months , they were shrinking , and now weâ??ve got them flattening out , and they look like theyâ??re going to grow . And Iâ??m just curious , just philosophically , if for example , systemic system wide loans grow 5% in the year ahead just to pick a number , should we expect JPMorganâ??s loan volumes and then the attendant net interest revenues also to grow kind of in proportion at 5%, or do you think that you have a larger runoff portfolios than average and that that would keep you down â?? your trends below the industry ?  Hey , I just had a follow up on the private label securities reserves . I think I heard you say , and I may have misheard you , but I think I heard you say that you thought you were at this point fully reserved for what you think the cost there could be over time . Should we assume that thatâ??s based on your belief that youâ??re not responsible for the WaMu stuff that was originated before and which you believe is the FDICâ??s responsibility ?  A third of the total issuance was what WaMu did prior to failing ? Right , right .  So it\\'s just like stepping stones for that , right ? If you have someone that starts a checking account [indiscernible] (42:08) and they start wanting to put aside money to save in an investment , in a mutual fund , are you going to lose that [indiscernible] (42:19).  Aside from a savings account , and there\\'s a money market , do you have a mechanism that they can start investing in mutual funds or stocks on a small level .  Okay . And one more thing . Your net interest income grew in Q4 despite the NIM headwinds and the runoff . And I understand your NIM percentage outlook , but I guess what helped you grow NII dollars this quarter ? And do you think you can grow NII dollars in 2013?  Marianne , I noticed that the global liquidity balance was up about $50B q-over-q to just a little bit under $500B . Is that in line with your guidance that youâ??re going to meet the LCR requirements by the end of the year or is there something else going on there ?  Okay . Thatâ??s it for me . Thank you .  Could you tell us what the duration of the securities portfolio is ?  Okay . And I may have missed it â?? I may have missed this so I apologizeâ?¦  How much would you estimate at the long end of the curve would you need to see the long end of the curve go up to mitigate the margin pressures so that you could actually see maybe margins not go down ?  And then as we look into 2013, I was trying to take a little bit of your outlook and just kind of create a net progression . If you look at the $1B that you basically highlighted in margin compression , you have a natural offset that youâ??ve explained in the servicing expenses of about $400mm . So if you take your current run rate of operating of $1.35, annualize that to $5.40, youâ??ve probably got somewhere between $0.07 and $0.10 worth of negative that comes out of that from netting out the positive that you have in the servicing expenses from margin compression .  If you then move incrementally for growth , if you offset a lot of the margin compression with loan and deposit growth , then youâ??re being able to generate about $1B of incremental just growth in overall balance sheet . If you look at expenses savings and then some reduction in shares , you can kind of look at how you would layer in towards , you know , something like 10% kind of growth next year as you kind of mirror those kind of big moving pieces . So , just want to make sure weâ??re tracking those and if you had any other thoughts about incremental opportunities to create EPS next year ?  Can you give us an update on where you are on the synthetic portfolio ? I know you probably donâ??t want to give a dollar amount , but is it mostly gone and what the timeframe is of that , even if itâ??s a modest drag , just having off the books completely ?  Okay . Thatâ??s helpful . And then just maybe on the deposit growth . I think you were up on a period end basis $54B . Is there any way to kind of get a sense of how much of that is sticky ? Or was that just sort of fiscal cliff concerns ? Or was it the TAG , the TAG-related deposits ? Do you have any sense on what was driving that and if itâ??s just more sustainable organic growth ? That would be helpful .  I just wanted to talk about the leverage ratio for a moment . You talked about a 10 basis point increase from the latest on Basel if they do the add-ons . And I guess the big part thatâ??s hardest for us to see is really the impact of the CDS non-netting of mismatched maturities on protection bought vs . protection sold . Can you give us a sense of what your numbers look like on that basis so we can try and reconcile to your 10BPS ? Got it . And can you just give us a sense for what the maturity profile looks like on your CDS protection purchased vs . sold ? Is there much of a maturity mismatch there , or is there really not much ? Marianne , I just wanted to follow up on a couple of things . One was on NIM outlook . You did indicate that in H2 2014 you were expecting that the CIO and Treasury income would turn positive , if I read it correctly . And I would think thatâ??s a function of your security yield improving . Can you just give us a sense of what the net new investment yield is for the security investments that youâ??re making in that book right now relative to what itâ??s at , the balances are at ? Right . And so given your comments that youâ??re expected to reach breakeven by H2 2014, thatâ??s a reflection of higher interest rates or a change in the way youâ??re investing the funds ? Okay . And then your other point was youâ??re going to be taking that better return on that portfolio and using it to be as competitive as you want to be on the loan portfolio , and so expectation is that loan spreads continue to pull down over the next couple of quarters at least . Can you just give us a sense as to how willing you are to be competitive on price on loan spreads ? Should we be expecting that overall NIM compression is what youâ??re looking for here in the event that you get the quality of loan growth you want ? Okay . And on the consumer side , card balances have been rewritten post-crisis to be variable . Are you anticipating that youâ??re going to be in a rising rate environment , in the belly of the curve raising rates on the card portfolio ? One more quick follow-up on the net interest margin outlook , Marianne . The NIM expected to be flattish , but I wasnâ??t clear from the current rate environment that you expected to continue to add investments as you have been doing . Would you expect the net interest income dollars to grow from here as they did slightly this quarter ? But what about just taking advantage of the ten-year yields moving up and your overall sensitivity to higher rates ? Right , okay . And then just moving on to your comments about being potential cautiously optimistic about back-end growth for loans , I presume that thatâ??s mostly focused on commercial lending . Is it still your view that the canary in the coal mine for seeing that might be slower deposit growth or in fact negative deposit growth before you start to see loan growth ?   Jamie Dimon Chairman & Chief Executive Officer , JPMorgan Chase & Co .  And what was the loan utilization rate for wholesale or commercial loans ? Okay . And then just separately , as we think about potential legal uncertainties or risks going forward , are there a couple that you flag out there that are the ones that we should be watching most closely for the industry for you guys , whether itâ??s LIBOR or FX ? Or feels like youâ??ve obviously settled a lot on the mortgage side , a couple of the big ones that were specific to you . What should we be watching to make sure that we have a sense of whatâ??s going on ? You mentioned that your utilization rate in the commercial area is in the low 30% range presently . And you also pointed out that youâ??re optimistic about the U .S . economy for this year being stronger and then the positive impact it will have on loan demand . What do you think the utilization rate could get to by year end ?   Good . And then on the commercial real estate , as you guys pointed out , youâ??re having real good success in this area . What geographic regions of the country are you seeing the best success ? And then second , what product types are you finding are working the best in growing that book ? You also mentioned that you guys have about $350B on deposit at the Fed . If the Fed decides to eliminate the interest they pay on those deposits to all the banks , will that change your strategy of keeping that amount up at the Fed ? I just wanted to follow up on the loan growth expectations . If we adjust for the typical seasonality associated with the credit card loans , which obviously is high in Q4, it looks like your core growth rate in loans was something like 60 or 70BPS sequentially , which would obviously translate into roughly a 2.5% annual growth rate .   Jamie Dimon Chairman & Chief Executive Officer , JPMorgan Chase & Co .Yes , Iâ??m talking about reported , correct . It just seems that the 2.5% seems like a fairly robust figure . So I just wanted to get your view about what the run rate of core loan growth might be . So Iâ??m just trying to reconcile that back to the NII dollar expectations , which seem fairly flat . But if the loan growth continues fairly strong and the expectation is to continue to deploy capital into securities opportunistically and the CIO portfolio is approaching breakeven , why is the expectation not for a stronger net interest income dollar growth ?   Marianne Lake Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President , JPMorgan Chase & Co .A question on just the reinvestment strategy; Doug , you mentioned , going through page 14, the challenges . I guess the question is , do you , at this stage , continue reinvesting in RMBS to the extent that you have the runoff occurring today , obviously the front of the curve collapsed there in RMBS , or do you go into more Treasuries and Ginnies , given the fact that youâ??re a little light on that asset class anyway , relative spread has improved ? Or do you loosen the credit box and try to drive up the loan growth ?  And on the loan side , you think you can drive some incremental loan growth through just pricing activity , just being more competitive on rate ?  Iâ??m really interested in getting your view on how you think QE3 overall is going to impact JPMorgan specifically . So we can see obviously the short-term benefits of a lot of mortgage origination revenue , potentially a positive impact on the economy , but of course the negative is lower mortgage rates , lower MBS rates , and what that does to the margin . So Iâ??m just sort of interested in getting your view on is QE3 a good thing or a bad thing for JPMorgan .  How do you think about this idea that , in the near term , clearly , youâ??re going to mint a lot of extra money on the mortgage refi boom , but once thatâ??s behind you , youâ??re simply left with a lower margin ? How much does that concern you or not ?  First question is , what is loan utilization this quarter vs . the last few quarters ?  And your margin guidance , it seemed a little bit worse than before . Is that simply due to QE3?  But you say for a few more quarters; it seems like itâ??s pressure for longer , or no ?  And part of that adjustment , is that being more competitive on pricing for loans ?  I guess what Iâ??m leading to is how elastic is loan pricing . If you assume that the lack of loan growth in aggregate for the U .S . is not due to the supply of money , but itâ??s due to the demand for money , will lowering pricing actually improve that demand ? And I know itâ??s a difficult question to answer , but it goes to how much lower you might want to price your loans .  And then a question on your deposit costs , theyâ??re down about six basis points q-over-q , as you mentioned , Doug , in your prepared remarks . One side of the question is how much lower do you think you can get those , and if youâ??re not able to drive those down , what affect does that have on NIM pressure over the next couple of quarters ?   Okay . And then on the net interest margin , Doug , it was up a bit this quarter . It looks like maybe some of the trading funding cost was lower . Can you talk about what drove that and what kind of outlook do you have for the NIM in 2012?   In the past when we were going the other way , you were kind enough to give us some sensitivities around what happens if housing goes down x%. Iâ??m not if you have gotten that optimistic to calculate it , but how sensitive is the whole balance sheet and earnings sheet to that improvement ?  Right . So thatâ??s tied to transaction volume in housing and how you get down â?? bringing down your OREO in delinquency . My last question just has to do with the outlook for home prices and transactions . I know the question was already asked , but I wanted to ask in conjunction to , you know , the PCI impairment that you took and the reduction in the portfolio there .  Right , and so â?? but youâ??ve made a change in your PCI reserves this quarter .  The second thing linked to this , do you think this will change theâ?¦?   The second thing is do you think this will meaningfully change the speed of delevering of assets coming out of Europe as a result of European banks having such a significant amount of three-year funding ?  You talked , you know , weâ??ve talked a little bit about some of the potential impact or the strong loan growth impact that youâ??ve gotten from some of the Euro deleveraging , but I guess I was just looking at the very strong commercial loan growth , wholesale loan growth and trying to get some idea of how much of that was coming excluding any Euro impact . Just from core customers , either using more on working capital lines or investing in CapExs , and whatâ??s your outlook for that continuing ?  Nevertheless , youâ??re saying and maybe youâ??re gaining share in terms of line of credit , but youâ??re saying youâ??re not seeing an uptick in utilization on the lines of credit ?  Yeah . First , Iâ??d like to follow up on the last question . When you look at wholesale loan growth , it was up 37% annualized in Q4. So it just seems as though there must be some sort of reintermediation by your bank from the capital markets back to the traditional banking ? I mean , how can 37% annualized loan growth be sustainable ? So my question isâ?¦?  Itâ??s still 20% annualized loan growth . Iâ??m trying to understand the flight to quality benefit . Are people moving business out of the capital markets back to the banks ?  Still , the more general question , the impact from capital markets to traditional banking , look at noninterest bearing deposits , they were up $40B in three months . Thatâ??s a 50% annualized growth rate . It seems like somethingâ??s happening in terms of people moving at least their money to you if not wholesale loans .  One last unrelated question . It seems like RFS keeps having negative operating leverage . I know youâ??re investing a lot , and Iâ??m sure weâ??ll hear about this at investor day . It seems like an awful big branch build strategy thatâ??s not paying off yet and itâ??s during a period of â?? when deposits arenâ??t worth as much in low rate environment . Does that really make sense ?  Just the low rate environment and the deposits arenâ??t worth as much .  Got it , okay . I wanted to ask a little bit about liquidity coverage and you know , the ratios . The Fed has indicated that the U .S . banks are going to have to undergo a liquidity stress test on a regular basis . Youâ??ve mentioned that your concernâ?¦  Fair enough . Itâ??s just that youâ??ve mentioned when looking at the Basel liquidity rules that have been proposed that it bothers you that they donâ??t credit some of the advantages that U .S . banks have like the guarantees on agency securities and the access to the Fed window , and I was just wondering if you believe that you have been heard on those things , that the Fed will take those things appropriately into account ?   So the fact that you mentioned you deployed liquidity during the quarter and that was one of the things that helped with the net interest margin . Thatâ??s not that youâ??re feeling more comfortable with this or what the Fed is saying ? Itâ??s justâ?¦?  Got it . From what you know of the Fed liquidity rules if they were , in fact , if they were implementing their stress tests right now , do you think you would be compliant with what theyâ??re looking for ?  Following up on the earlier comment that the NIM percent might be down a little bit in Q1. If we think about the net interest income dollars , should we see continued growth off of this level ?  Just a flat to up comment , is that for Q1 or just and if you are growing loans consistently throughout next year , it seems like you could have an upward trajectory throughout the year .  Is there a possibility â?? since your deposit market share doesnâ??t exceed 10% of the total U .S . deposits , which would prevent somebody from buying another bank , but the too big to fail doctrine seems to be weighing on your bank and a few others . Do you think you could , if M&A comes back , could you guys buy depositories in the U .S .?  Got it , thank you . Then on commercial wholesale , should we expect incremental build for the growth that youâ??re seeing , or how should I think about that ?  Just one other question . On the long-term debt , it was down $17B in the quarter after being pretty stable for the prior three . Is that just a function of the markets werenâ??t conducive to rolling over debt , or are you looking to actively to reduce that over time ?  Should we expect that to go down , or is it just going to bounce around with your balance sheet ?  Got it . Given your relative optimism on housing , are there things that could be done to help the down payment piece ? That seems to be the last piece thatâ??s really hard to kind of bring to the table .  Jamie in that regard , wondering the ECB seems to be constantly easing its collateral standards . What are the risks that you might worry about in that regard as they keep easing their standards to provide liquidity as the banks have to meet the requirements that youâ??ve referred to ?  My second question would be you mentioned share repurchase quite a bit in your commentsâ?¦?  Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo . Maybe a couple of clarifying questions , if I could . First of all , in terms of the deposit growth that you\\'ve been talking about , how are you thinking about deposits moving out of the bank when rates go up ? And how do you intend to capture those deposits moving into other JPM or Chase products rather than having them move out into other areas of the market ? And then maybe a separate question ...  Yes , a multi-part question . And in terms of mortgages Kevin , you talked about on Slide 42 the ongoing mortgage portfolio rising by about $20 billion in 2014 versus 2013. How much of that is market share gain and how much of that in terms of origination ? And how much of that is just you keeping more of what you\\'re originating on the balance sheet just to help NII ?  Maybe on the card business , you talked about â?? Eileen talked about the good momentum in terms of the balance in the new vintages . Could you talk a little bit about the flows on both sides and when that really starts to turn in terms of growth in the underlying receivables ?  The firm said it had been slowing down some commercial loan growth due to competition , how are you seeing competition right now ? And how are you reacting ?  I have three questions . First , I\\'m just looking for your insight on the first one . I calculate your loan to deposit ratio for the last four years having gone from 77% down to 58%. Now you can compute that a few different ways , but that\\'s â?? it\\'s low however you slice it . What\\'s going on at JPMorgan and the banking industry that the loan deposit ratio is so low ? Are banks functioning to facilitate the economy as much as they should be ? Or has the de-risking and de-leveraging gone too far ?  So lastly then as you move forward , have you done the mix shift so that now the inflection point , you\\'re not so saturated that all the positive things you\\'ve done still have momentum , while all the negative things you had to replace are now at a place where they\\'re stable , so you can start generating that revenue growth from the metrics ?  So you guys have a lot of excess cash and you indicated that part of the reason is because of the clearing business and other assorted pieces . But there\\'s some excess cash sitting on top of that that you\\'re leaving at the Fed . So I guess the question is , is there any kind of regulatory clarity that then when we get allows you to start to reinvest some of that excess cash ? Or you\\'re just going to sit on it ?  Okay . So the second question I wanted to ask is about loan pricing . So , we\\'ve heard from a number of ...  So we\\'ve heard from a number of your peers this morning that the loan pricing environment is getting tougher in certain footprints and in certain product lines . Mainly , I think , as banks search for lending opportunities just given the lack of reinvestment side on the securities side of the business . Can you talk a little bit about what you\\'re seeing in terms of loan pricing and how that\\'s evolved in the last few months ?  Yes , understood; and then maybe , Doug , one for you , a more technical one . On page 42 of the supplement , weâ??ve seen a big jump up this quarter in some of the repurchase demand buckets by certain vintages in 2005. And what was surprising was even the post-2008 stuff . And I guess my question there is , is that the same GSE monoline stuff that weâ??ve seen , or is a new player in town with the FHA ? Any color around that would be great .   Okay . And is the FHA going with the GSE playbook , and do they have the same rep and warranty ?  So my question has to do with your Trust Preferred Securities . I think you have nearly $20B of callable TruPS , and just wondered what your thoughts are about calling them and the timing of calling them .  So should we potentially think about you calling those sometime next year perhaps ?  Doug , a question on the net interest income and spread compression . Could you remind us of that repositioning youâ??ve been doing that you talked about in last several quarters in the investment portfolio; and just at the top of the house , your outlook for net interest income and maybe the margin ?  What about any offsets on the cost of funding side in terms of lowering your deposit rates , your CDs , paying off longer-term debt; is that embedded into your outlook ? And just a reminder , when you net all of that together , how are you thinking about NII the next couple quarters ?  Okay . And then , Jamie , you made a comment about ...  When you look at your net interest margin , your cost of deposits are about 63BPS , and youâ??ve been having outstanding deposit growth . Your loan-to-deposit ratio continues to fall . How low do you think you can take those deposit rates down to , especially in light of the fact that Bernanke has said that heâ??s going to keep short-end rates low until sometime in 2013?  Let me just follow up . I mean , twelve of the thirteen largest banks that would have failed , I think you would be the one bank that wouldnâ??t have failed during the crisis . Is that correct ? And if thatâ??s the case â?? whatâ??s that ?  Two questions . One , how sensitive is net interest income to changes in long-term rates ? So for example , rates have popped about 50BPS here . If Europe gets resolved and we go up another 50BPS , how meaningful would that be ?  All right . And obviously if long rates go up , then you might extend out your securities or things like that ?  If long rates go up enough , that would make you change your strategy in your securities portfolio that could be additive as well ?  A couple of quick just cleanup questions . On the $400mm net income impact of spread compression next year in terms of an estimate , obviously I appreciate your comments about how you can move things around on the balance sheet . But does that also build in some expectation for deposit and loan growth , or should we look at that as additive if that were to occur ?  Okay , so somewhat of a catch-up , but also not great trends . And then lastly , any comment on the thought of the Fed taking away the 25BPS on excess reserves , how that might impact you or the markets ? Itâ??s hard to get a sense of how much you have parked there . And if you had to go into the short-term treasury markets and buy up six-month , one- year , five to ten basis points vs . 25, is that a material impact or not ? And how do you think that affects the curve overall ?  Right , because some people buy the loans and keep the wrapper even though they hold it in loan form ?  Thanks . Two questions one , you mentioned that the 20% through the cycle ROE target is not your hurdle rate for loans . That makes sense because I dont know anyone who â?? that are hitting hurdle here right now . But is that your hurdle rate for the relationship that you would have with a customer ?  And could you just spend a little bit of time on the commercial real estate opportunity ? In past years , expanding your footprint in CRE , at least in the U .S , was pretty important to how you were going to be getting the asset growth . I didn\\'t see as much in this deck on CRE , specifically . Could you just talk to -  Yeah , as a follow-up on the C&I , the multifamily market , we hear that\\'s also very overheated . Now as you have the housing market coming back , are you seeing any weakness in that market ? And is it also very competitive ?  Thanks , the last ticky-tack question is just on excess deposits . You talked about flight to safety , flight to quality in the past . Can you give us an update where you stand today on the level that you may have that may go away if re-risk income stays back ?  Nature hates a vacuum , so if there\\'s no questions , I\\'ll ask one . So there are a lot of policy proposals on the housing market kind of flying around and I know that you\\'ll say that given your resources , no matter what the policy environment is , you\\'ll thrive and I get that . But what would you prefer to see for housing finance in the U .S . and I guess as part of that , do we really need a 30-year fixed rate mortgage for the housing market ?  Okay . Curious , we donâ??t have all the answers on how the whole leverage focus is going to shake out , but it seems â?? Iâ??m putting little words in your mouth , but it seems to be working its way through a little bit . I think your book is down 15% or so year-on-year and itâ??s less than 10% of the overall balance sheet . But is that a correct way to think about it , that that focus is going to start impacting the repo market ? And Iâ??m just curious if you could talk about , for your book , what is balance sheet financing versus real customer financing . Okay . Maybe a last one . In a world that doesnâ??t have a lot of loan growth , has very low interest rates and capital markets have been far from ideal , to your point , your underlying business are operating good . Then , ex the charge , youâ??re earning at that $6 run rate that people are hoping you could get to . I guess the question is , do you have more confidence than you did last year in terms of that $24 billion over the cycle , because youâ??re kind at that run rate now , with not ideal conditions ? Okay . And portfolio sale coming up at all in that ? Three small questions and then one larger one . First , what was the loan utilization on the wholesale side for the quarter versus last quarter ? Whatâ??s the total dollar amount of all the losses weâ??re talking about for this potential settlement ? That must be public somewhere . For mortgage put-back in aggregate , the mortgage securities , what are the dollar amounts of the original â?? whatâ??s the original principal amount , whatâ??s the investor loss , just the dollar amounts , if you can break that down ? Can you give us a sense for whether thatâ??s right ? And where you are with that runoff portfolio ? Thank you . Good morning . Can you guys talk about the commercial loan balances ? I noticed that the period-end balances had a nice increase from the third quarter but your averages were almost flat . Was there a pickup in lending activity in the month of September ? Coming back to the asset yields , you talked about the deposit margin improving quarter-to-quarter earlier in your call . Are we at a point where the asset yields in the securities portfolio have bottomed ? Are you replacing securities with securities with equal yields or higher ? Hey . Good morning . One quick follow-up on your liquidity holdings , your excess liquidity pool , looks like it increased almost $85 billion sequentially to $538 billion . I just want to know whatâ??s driving that , if thereâ??s anything youâ??re worried about or thinking about because I thought your LCR ratio last quarter was above 100%. And if you could just give us your updated LCR ratio , thatâ??d be great . Thanks . Okay . So you are sitting on kind of excess cash that youâ??re kind of waiting for a very better environment to invest ?  If we started to see the 10 year go up consistently without Fed Funds moving up would that be something you could take advantage of or when you say rates going up , Jamie , it is really the ...  And then more fundamentally , thereâ??s a benefit from just kind of the shorter Fed Funds going up eventually ?  And then more generally , you mentioned that NII could see some additional pressure , what would be the biggest source of ongoing margin pressure as it relates to the low rates ?  And then lastly , why donâ??t we have bigger loan growth ? It looks youâ??re â?? you mentioned you had record middle market loan balances but still wholesale loan growth vs . Q4 increased at the slowest pace since six quarters ago . So if we have for good borrowers the most benign rate environment in our lifetime , why wouldnâ??t we see more loan growth in aggregate ?  So just one overview insight . It seems like traditional banking isnâ??t doing so great: NII down , margin down , loans were flat for the quarter , utilization hasnâ??t changed . On the other hand , the capital markets are doing great , you have phenomenal issuance , great trading . Is there some insight you can give us into the industry ? We have lower rates . Itâ??s not necessarily fueling traditional banking . On the other hand , capital markets are doing well . Is this just exaggerated disintermediation ? Or how would you describe the current environment ?  Morning , guys . I just wanted to circle back on the margin commentary and NII . I think you mentioned that perhaps in Q2 there could still be some pressure but we shouldnâ??t really read into that in terms of pressure throughout the year . I just wanted to tie that back to the full year commentary about the real estate run off drag of , I think , $500mm y-over-y as well as the consumer business banking drag of I think you still think about $400mm . How do we think about it in terms of potentially when there would be an inflection point ?  Got it , thatâ??s helpful . And then any sense of when the real estate drag kind of starts to slow down ? When can we see an inflection in terms of C&I in business banking maybe growth offsetting that drag ? Is it by the end of the year or do we have to wait until next year ?  Okay . I got you . Thank you . And one last question on the margin , the one thing that was a little strange was that the long-term debt cost jumped pretty material , about 56BPS sequentially . Was that related to â?? was there something about last quarter where you had some debt gains that kind of skewed that or why would the long-term debt numbers be going up so materially ?  Yeah , thank you very much . Hey , Jamie , just change the conver â?? the discussion a little bit , weâ??re hearing out there for loan growth people that are getting loan growth that thereâ??s a lot of price competition and underwriting competition , especially in the commercial markets . And a lot of people bring up your name as being one of the most competitive out there for pricing . I was just wondering if you could add some color to that ? And are you taking outsized interest rate risk growing your portfolio ?  So you hedge â?? so youâ??re just saying youâ??re hedging most of those â?? youâ??re doing fixed rate at five or seven years , youâ??re hedging all that out ?  Maybe with avoiding too much of the detail , stay at the high level and to talk about no loan growth on a year-on-year basis . I know thereâ??s a bunch of much mix in there , and I guess Iâ??m particularly interested in the C&I bucket because thatâ??s the one area where we do see some growth in the industry . So A), thereâ??s a little bit of the verbiage in your text on how you define C&I loan growth in the corporate bucket . And B), are there areas where you just think pricing is getting a little high and youâ??re purposely avoiding that growth ? I appreciate that . And then obviously over time weâ??ll see that in both the steady or up NIM and good delinquency trends , I guess . Okay . And just the second question , given than youâ??re already compliant in the LCR , is it fair for us to assume that your core margin should continue to improve throughout the year at this measured pace ? Okay . And that 40 basis point benefit there is both for the bank level and the HoldCo level ? Okay . Speaking of the PCI loans , they were down y-over-y about 10% to 12%. Should we expect that type of run rate throughout the year as that portfolio continues to shrink ? Okay . And then finally , it may just be market conditions or maybe something you can do . When you look at your net interest margin and you look at the interest earning asset yields , the securities borrowed number was a negative 30BPS . Itâ??s been trending more negative each quarter . It was minus two basis points a year ago . Can you point to anything you could do to try to reverse that ? Okay . So then , the other topic I just want to touch on is rates , rising rates , rate volatility . Obviously , we\\'ve moved into a little bit more uncertain territory and being that you\\'re running a large balance sheet I just want to get an understanding of how you and the team are managing through that rate risk ? Is it different today than it was a couple of years back , when we were just starting easy-money policy ?  And what\\'s your sense on the backup in the 10-year and the impact on the cost of a residential mortgage loan ? Has that impacted your business ?  Right . I think the initial one , they asked for more support , the investors ?  [Inaudible] (2:42:22) you\\'ve got a great closed loop environment that I feel like has not yet been fully harvested , so to speak . Maybe you could give us a little bit of a sense as to what you\\'re doing in terms of mix up there . And in particular , I also just want to [ph] achieve (2:42:33) that a little bit for private label , which you\\'ve been walking away from . How much more is left to walk away from your portfolio ?  Yeah , you explained your market share gains , but why dont you think loan utilization has improved more , whether for you or for the industry ?  I think a lot of people got excited with the C&I loan growth in the industry and you talked about a lot of it being market share , not necessarily economic growth . Can balance sheets like JPMorgan grow just through market share international and stealing business from the smaller guys ? Or do you â?? do we really need economic growth for these balance sheets to grow , especially at these levels ?  Then just on money market funds , you indicated about 40% of them are floating NAV . Can you just give us a sense of the customer , the geographies at that investment ?  Going to your chart on 5 showing how GDP has gotten more capital-intensive over time . I mean I guess I think that\\'s wonderful , you\\'re saying it\\'s great , financial assets grow faster than GDP . Other people look at that chart and they say this is terrible , this is the debt super cycle , we have to undo all this and bring debt levels down . So I mean do you have a view on how sustainable the debt is ? And if you do have deleveraging , in particular in the more mature economies , what is the revenue impact of that on your business ?  Hello . So first question on â?? deposit growth has been great and I guess would love to see higher rates in loan growth , but youâ??re positively positioned for the parallel shift up . I guess my first question is how does that change in a more of a flattening environment that weâ??re experiencing right now ? Do you capture most of the benefit anyway , just getting off zero on the short end ? Got it and then the last one for me , Marianne , you gave some clarification around loan growth in the CIB , but Iâ??m not sure I quite understood it . Basically , you said the minus 5% headline number was affected by a couple of , it sounded like , one-time-ish kind of things in what the underlying was . But as I said , Iâ??m not sure I really caught your drift . And how much â?? what was the dollar amount of that impact ? Great . And the second follow-up question is , given your expectations for rates to rise in the middle of next year , are you still â?? and the continued progress you make on deposit share , are you still expecting $100 billion in deposit outflows in that case ? So , appreciate that the repo book is substantially client-driven . Was maybe hoping that you guys could give us some sense for how much of your repo book is firm financing versus facilitation .   Alright , thatâ??s fair . And then last one from me . So in looking at the NIM simulation that you guys have provided , and then taking a look at that in light of the interest rate shock disclosures youâ??ve got in your Qs . It looks like 200 basis point rate shock adds about half of what youâ??re looking for in a normalized rate environment . So I guess , does that mean that the subsequent years sort of the benefit of rolling the portfolio into higher rates is going to exceed the higher deposit costs by about $4 billion to $5 billion ? And then is there a particular time period that we should think about that , or is it going to be too heavily influenced by competitive dynamics ? Hi , thanks . Good morning . Just a tactical follow-up just on the balance sheet . With the non-interest bearing deposits basically being the fastest growing category of the balance sheet , and the resulting asset , the deposits with banks also being the fastest growing asset on the balance sheet . Just within that context of what you just walked through with Brennan , Iâ??m just wondering what changes structurally with the way you think about reinvesting in the securities portfolio with rates as low as they are now , loan growth is okay but , to your point , youâ??re being somewhat selective on â?? and want to be careful with pricing and credit .  So just from a , more so taking the next year or so out , how are your thoughts changing at all with respect to what you do with these deposits , given that they might actually not flow out as much given that change to the RRP function . Got it . And then just one final one from me , you mentioned something about how you thought that the compensatory payments to the state AGs were going to be used , but I\\'m not sure I caught it . What do you think is the disposition of those funds ?  And if we think of it as pending things , like Deutsche Bank and then the institutional investors covered by this , it would seem the probability of other investors getting a 25% kind of hurdle to really pursue things more would be a stretch . Am I classifying that incorrectly ?  Good afternoon . I have a question about the $4 billion restitution . After we\\'ve been through HARP/HAMP modifications , write-downs , principal forgiveness , et cetera , et cetera , I\\'m sort of scratching my head about what is left out there to do . So was this number arrived at through some methodical look at principal balances remaining , et cetera , et cetera , or was this just one more round of shakedown ?  Will the $2 billion that is â?? I believe you said there would be $2 billion of this that would be dedicated to low-income lending . Is that going to count against your CRA obligations ?  What\\'s the elasticity of demand , do you think ? Let\\'s say you go down to the absolute minimum , what would be your best guess [inaudible] (33:01)...  Jamie , you obviously have a good view of the U .S . economy . Are you seeing improving demand from both consumers and corporates , are you seeing corporate loan demand becoming more broad-based ?  Thanks , Marianne . That was very fulsome , and you answered a lot of my questions that I sent to you ahead of time . We do have about 10 minutes here for Q&A . And if I just summarize what at least I heard , strong core loan growth 5%, cross-sell added $15 billion or was responsible for $15 billion worth of revenues ... ...in 2013. Capital targets 10% to 10.5%, on path to get there end of this year , middle of next , something like that . You\\'ve got excess liquidity , so that\\'s under-earning a little bit during that ... Appropriate liquidity , which could shrink as rates rise . Okay . And as rates rise , in your base case , 200 bps on the long end , 400 bps on the front end , $8 billion to $10 billion of higher net interest income , right ? Got it , okay . So then one topic that wasn\\'t discussed was what if rates do not go up . And how do you think about that given what the ECB has done recently ? ... which is causing a smaller housing market , which is one of the drivers for GDP . So how do you contrast those two forecasts where you forecast a higher rate and forecast a modest mortgage market ? And if you are on the other hand expecting a more broader loan market to below 700, I could understand the consistency , but I\\'m not sure how both happen at the same time . I\\'m wondering if you may have more wood to chop on that front , or if you think you do , or some of the issuance and all the things that you\\'ve talked about on the liquidity front get you more ready for that . Hi . You talked about core loan growth in the 5% range . In the Investor Day , there was a slide that illustrated on the mortgage business that there\\'s a legacy portfolio that\\'s been running off and a core portfolio that\\'s been growing . Could you talk a little bit about loan growth on a net basis ? Maybe it\\'s a 2015 comment because it sounds like legacy portfolios are shrinking at about the rate that the core portfolio is growing in 2014, but that the lines are going to cross at some point ? Great , thanks . Was that â?? the $1 billion of securities gain you said was related to that coming out of CIO . Was that part of the same reduction , and could you talk a little bit about the process of kind of mitigating the risk of the balance over the next couple of quarters ?  Okay , I\\'m not asking for specific positions , just liquidity .  Yes , hi . You said that you still have an $8 billion gain in the AFS securities portfolio . So should we assume that that\\'s a combination of some gains and sort of the plain vanilla of investment portfolio securities that you\\'d normally have and then a negative position here ?  Thanks for coming clean on this , and I think it\\'s important that you did . I guess the question I really had is , you\\'re open about the strategy , that it was poorly monitored . But the real question I guess I had is , do you feel that the hedge put on or the position put on , was the intention really to kind of hedge , or do you feel like the person who put it on , his intention for prop bets ? Or to make -  Can you tell me on the NII outlook , what are the drivers of the strong growth in earning assets you expect that you just mentioned on the NII page ?  Okay . But itâ??s steady throughout the year , thatâ??s what I was getting at .  And then on the NIM and the LCR thereâ??s obviously an interplay there and could you just give us an update on where you are with the LCR this quarter because your NIM decline this quarter actually was a lot lighter than what we were expecting ?  Yeah , letâ??s hope so . Okay and then the spread in mortgage compression was kind of meaningful here this quarter . What inning do you think weâ??re in there , ballpark ? I know itâ??s kind of tough to predict as well .  Loan growth is a little bit softer and I think you mentioned there was some push forward to Q4 but you also mention more competition and lower levels of demand if I heard you correctly . So my question is how much of the softer loan growth is due to JPMorgan perhaps pulling back ? And how much is due to the economy ?  So really on the lower level of demand , what was your loan utilization in Q1 vs . Q4?  Flat . And is that just â?? why arenâ??t people borrowing more ?  And then , Marianne , a question on NIM , clearly your moves on the LCR had some effect on NIM over the last quarter or two . Can you separate what you think the net interest margin movements will be for JPMorgan , ex-your â?? excluding your moves for the LCR ? Or is it just so intertwined that you really canâ??t do that ?  I had some questions on the Commercial Banking line of business . You had a nice increase in the real estate lending area in Q1, looked like it was about $9B after four quarters of essentially flat to down real estate loans . Can you give us some color on where the growth was ?  Following up on your guysâ?? answer about corporate deposits dropping in the quarter , which obviously is a good sign if companies are using this for capital improvements , whatâ??s your outlook â?? do you expect that to continue ? Should we see that as a continued positive trend ?  How much â?? I mean I donâ??t know if you can disclose this or not but how much do think that you have HARP eligible ? And how many of those HARP-eligible loans did you do on a percentage basis ? Do you think youâ??ve touched most of them already ?  Do you see , going forward , that changing in the way you are approaching your interest sensitivity as the likelihood of rising interest rates increases in 2015? Or should it remain pretty much constant ? Tying in to the higher interest rates , youâ??ve been vocal about your funding side of the equation and what you expect there . Can you give us an update or more color of how youâ??re positioned for the funding side of the balance sheet should rates rise ? How much you expect to potentially maybe move off your balance sheet as it gets repriced into different types of products ? Just to follow up on the interest rate point for a second , I know you guys been very focused on the potential for a deposit drain as things are handled somewhat differently by the Fed , given the current circumstances when they eventually do raise rates . Is there any change in that thinking of the potential for a trillion-ish deposit drain and maybe $100mm for yourselves on the basis of the Fed minutes from last week which maybe were a little contradictory in terms of the mechanics , that Peterson Institute article which has been , I think , seminal everyoneâ??s thinking . Hello there . So weâ??ve seen a greater number of sales in the repo market . It seems to me just an issue of available collateral , but Iâ??m curious to get your take on how much weâ??re supposed to care on it and whether or not some of the actions by Treasury , in the reverse repo market , can take care of that ? Marianne , you mentioned a comment when you were talking about C&I loan growth , I just wanted to get a clarification . Last quarter , if I remember correctly it was about flattish on the year-on-year basis and you spoke about price competition and some discipline on JPMorganâ??s part . This quarter , you have a little bit more year-on-year growth , still mentioned the comment about discipline , but I just wanted to get a clarifying statement . Is just growth a little bit better , is the backdrop a little bit better and you expect to participate in that a little bit more ? I appreciate that . Last one is I just couldnâ??t help notice the balance sheet is now at $2.5 trillion . In your discussions , I know we canâ??t purchase our way through without jumping through a lot of hurdles but do you feel constrained on just sheer balance sheet size ? And the reason I ask is I look across most of your franchises , theyâ??re growing , theyâ??re growing nice and theyâ??re growing organically through the investments youâ??ve made . I just want to know if anybody is bringing up the issue of just absolute size ? Following up on loan growth commentary , net interest income dollars seemed a little better than you expected at the $11B . Are you still looking for that to be flattish kind of top of the house NII for this year or is the outlook a little better given the loan growth trends ? Okay . So , yes with the 5% core loan growth do you expect NII to be relatively flat this year and flat to up a little bit next year ? I always prefer more guidance than less . And then I have two have very simple questions with complicated answers , I guess , but you talked about loan growth . Is this the inflection point for loan growth ? And on the one hand , you said , well , thereâ??s some inventory build thatâ??s helping . On the other hand , youâ??re not seeing CapEx yet , and two quarters ago , you said H2, loan growth should really accelerate . Do you still believe it should accelerate from this level ? Is this acceleration or youâ??re revising back some of those expectations ? And if interest rates increase at some point , that could hurt the ability of commercial and commercial real estate borrowers to service their debt . How much cushion is there before you think for that would become an issue ? Or is that just not a factor ? Okay . Thatâ??s clear . And then just sort of a more conceptual question , I look at your core loan growth of 4%. Obviously , everyoneâ??s commented that thatâ??s very strong and I guess about two times the industry level . And Iâ??m kind of reconciling that with the comments you made about C&I loan growth thatâ??s kind of in line with the market , and youâ??re kind of seeing some market share on resi mortgage for all the reasons youâ??ve explained to us . So , I was just wondering if you could give some color on those areas where youâ??re clearly taking share . And just some outlook on how sustainable that is ? Or was it just kind of a good quarter ? And so â?? and this is the last thing for me . But does that suggest that maybe weâ??re getting closer to the point where the reported numbers in terms of the balance sheet â?? the loan expansion and the core numbers will get closer to converging ? So itâ??s how it flows through to you guys ? I know a lot of questions have been asked , but Iâ??m going to go back to the mortgages a little bit , of the $16B . The market was up and depending on who you listen to , probably in the $260B or $300B range , but you guys stayed relatively flat and it looks like really you guys gave up market share with MBS issuance , stuff that you sell to Fannie and Freddie and maybe you picked up more market share in the jumbo market . Of the $5B that you portfolioed , you talked about , was that all jumbos ? And you could talk a little bit about maybe stepping away from Fannie and Freddie ? And , Jamie , a follow-up question on your utilization comments which I thought was very good , but a lot of bankers have talked about as long as deposit is growing , itâ??s hard for that utilization rate to go up and we did see strong deposit growth and weâ??re still seeing utilization rates . Should that deposit growth start to go down , if weâ??re seeing an uptick in utilization rates ? So , Marianne , I actually had a question about the presentation that you had given last month at the Morgan Stanley Conference . You alluded to a targeted loan-to-deposit ratio of roughly 70% through the cycle . And I suppose , what I was wondering when crunching some of the numbers , given the tougher treatment for loans vs . high-quality securities under the LCR , whether thereâ??s a peak level of loan-to-deposit ratio or growth that we should think about , given the constraints which exist under the new liquidity regime . Thanks . And I suppose could you give potentially any context as to what event may prompt that re-pricing ? Whether â?? even if the leverage rules are finalized and officially implemented this year , do you expect that thatâ??s when youâ??ll begin to see a lot of your peers begin to re-price some of these effects into their inventory or into their trading securities ? Or are they likely going to delay at least the re-pricing until the rules are fully implemented , which is going to be a 2018 event ? Okay . Got you . And then , maybe just â?? I donâ??t know if itâ??s related or not , but as I look at your derivatives receivable on the balance sheet , itâ??s been declining pretty steadily; down 20% y-over-y . Is that reflective of just demand , given low volatility and low activity levels ? Or is there something structural there ? Are you guys actively managing your receivables down ? Just trying to get a sense of the cyclical vs . structural argument . Okay . You mentioned the mitigation you can do at the holding company , is there mitigation you can also do to help the â?? specifically , the bank level ratio in terms of maybe assets that could be shifted to the parent or equity that could go from the holding company to the sub and things like that ? Okay . And then on the liquidity ratio , I guess , why have you decided to run with this level of cushion to LCR and why the acceleration in getting there now ? Anything driving that in particular ? Okay . And could you give us some of the assumptions behind your outlook for stable net interest margin and modest net interest income growth in the back half of the year just in terms of maybe what youâ??re assuming on rates and loan growth ? And what are the puts and takes in your outlook ?   Okay . And then finally , Iâ??m not sure if I saw it in here or not , but can you remind us how much you benefit from higher rates and which rates in particular are most helpful for you ? You know , if you can go delineate between kind of the 10-year and then kind of the shorter based rates ? Understood . Thanks . Was there a change in the securities portfolio during the quarter ? And maybe could you give us an update on where that duration stands ? And is that just from managing a smaller inventory while the spreads were widening or ...? First I just wanted to follow-up on the comment . So over the next 12 months NII should benefit by 75% of the $900mm ? So in other words you should â?? in 2014 you should benefit by about $700mm . Okay . And when you say the benefits , the benefit of the 10-year increasing 100BPS ? I didnâ??t fully hear how you explained that . The reason I ask that is it seems as though maybe the ten-year is not as relevant as perhaps the five-year , or am I mistaken ? Or the three year ? So itâ??s about a three to four year run rate to get down to ultimately where you want to be ? Okay . You guys have had some great C&I loan growth in the middle market space over the last four , five , six quarters . It seemed to really slow down this quarter . Anything in particular happen ? Right . Fair enough . As I think about the changes that you can make to the business that you referred to on page 4 to mitigate the impact of the leverage ratio changes , you talked about optimizing the use of central clearing and yet thereâ??s also all these concerns about the disallowance of additional derivatives collateral . How comfortable are you that the way the rules are written right now , moving your derivatives business more towards central clearing really does , because of the collateral , give you a lot of relief on those leverage assets ? Great . Just , Jamie , following up on that , it just seems like even the $100B of increase in deposits this quarter probably cost you 15BPS in that leverage ratio . And so is there any movement , do you think , during the comment period towards exclusion of any of the risk-free assets at all ? Two questions . First on the branch banking network , I know this backup in rates has been primarily at the longer end and we have not yet had a corresponding rise in short-term rates but do you see any need at this point to re-price products , et cetera , at the branch level due to consumer perception of rising rates ? Marianne , can we just go back to the sequential NII guidance ? Can you help me understand how much of that is coming or what the attribution is between benefits to NIM vs . loan growth ? So I guess a couple of follow-ups then . I mean shouldnâ??t presumably then the benefits to the funding cost should show up through NIM , no ?   And then just within the composition of loan growth , if you divorce out the credit card seasonality , itâ??s been within a very stable range . What is it that in your view takes the loans out of the current range ? So in other words your loan growth has been â?? sorry not your growth but rather your loan balances have been between $725B and $727B or $728B very consistently for many quarters if you divorce out fourth quarter credit card seasonality . But it sounds like you have some expectation that it starts to move out of the range in order to generate this improvement in NII ? Iâ??m wondering what the driver of that is ? Last question , how do you feel about the extension of the FDIC transaction account guarantee program ?  The extended coverage to non-interest bearing transactions , [ph] deposits from the crisis (1:29:57)?  And then my last one , I donâ??t know if you can comment on this , but it would be helpful to know , do you guys have specific controls that separate communications between derivatives traders and the LIBOR rate submission employees ?  A question for Doug , you talked about some of the net interest margin pressure coming from hedge ineffectiveness . Could you quantify of the 10BPS how much you think that is ? And do you expect that to revert in Q3? And then just generally , given the really oppressively low interest-rate environment that weâ??re in right now , maybe some sense of your view on the net interest income trajectory of the company ?  Now the way I read it though in the home equity loans in particular it looked like for over 80% loan to values that you were going to have a 1.5 times capital charge â??  Take a bigger step back , if weâ??re going to be living with this flat yield curve , banks like to live with a steep yield curve . Thatâ??s what weâ??ve all been raised on for the last three or four decades , but if we are going to live in this environment , how do banks operate ? How do you position your institution to go forward with a continued flat yield curve ? You can adjust the balance sheet , thatâ??s a one-time issue , but going forward , how would you run this institution ?  On those assets and 76 liabilities . Two questions . Can you tell us how much of those are netted from the same counterparty ? And second , how much of those numbers was the CIO numbers in that at the end of that quarter ?  Two very quick follow-ups . One , I just want to make sure on the LIBOR issue , I understand all the things that you canâ??t talk about mid-investigation . But Iâ??m assuming this has been going on for a while that youâ??ve had three , six , maybe more months of internal investigations . Is there anything you can tell us and comment on , give ...  I actually had two , and Glenn , just stole them both . But the â?? I guess just one more slight attempt on the LIBOR , do you have any sense of how long the issue will overhang on the industry and whether weâ??ll get some kind of clarity about the investigations over the summer ? Or is this something that could drag on for a long time ? Any insight in when weâ??ll get some more information on it ?  Good morning , everyone . Thanks for having the call . Just a quick question â?? I didn\\'t see an update on the 2014 funding plan . Obviously , you all made a lot of progress in the first half . By our math , it actually looks like you could essentially be done . Obviously , there\\'s an opportunity to be opportunistic with rates and spreads where they are , but just wanted to get your thoughts there .  Okay . One last question . I was going through some notes the other day , and several quarters ago , you had talked about a goal of deposits plus shareholders\\' equity equaling 50% of the funding stack . You\\'re getting there pretty quickly . Is that still a goal ? Is that something that you would look to exceed over time ?  Thanks again for hosting the call . Just a question on slide 23, the liquidity reserve mix . The interest-bearing deposits with banks is down to 11% from 20%, while securities available for sale increased from 26% to 34% from the last six months or so . And I was just curious to see if you\\'re at the right mix there or how we should think about this going forward .  Good morning , everyone . Thanks for the call . This is probably for David . Going back to your comment about how issuance may not match maturities again in 2013, I was wondering if you could provide a little color . Obviously , there\\'re some offsets . You\\'ve got a huge excess liquidity pool . You\\'ve got incremental deposit inflows . But on the other side , you\\'ve got the last [ph] leg (20:20) of the JV to take down and about $24 billion â?? or $25 billion maturing this year . So can you give a little more color and maybe size it versus the $6 billion that you did in plain vanilla debt last year ?  Hi . Good morning . Thanks for doing the call .Okay . Thanks . Second question , in terms of subordinated debt , you did a subordinated debt issue a little while ago; it came around 100 basis points wide to the outstanding senior debt . Now , on a [ph] g-spread (24:11) basis , it\\'s trading about half of that . Could you give us an idea of how you look at subordinated debt and subordinated debt pricing , and what you think the proper senior sub spread ought to be ? We\\'re all struggling here with a very unclear picture on the OLA , certainly , together , but we also can\\'t work â?? as a result , we can\\'t really work back from recoveries . So , if you could , just paint us a picture of how you think about subordinated debt and what you think the right price should be , senior to subordinated debt , for an institution like yours ?  Okay . Last one on the sub debt , and thank you for outlining all your ways that you can fund the company in various markets , but in your assessment , have you come to the conclusion that the U .S . market is the broadest and deepest for subordinated debt , whereas the other markets are better for senior debt , probably five years and in , or is there any other light you can shed on that ?  Great . Thanks . So we noticed that deposits in the bank deposit program fell this quarter . Was that seasonal ? And can you help us think about that this year ? Because it didnâ??t seem like we noticed as much of a seasonal decline in prior years , so was there anything unusual going on there ? You mentioned youâ??re moving to leverage your status as the tenth largest depository in the U .S . And looking at the bank data from Call Reports , it looks like the ROA of the bank is only 60BPS and Iâ??m not sure if we should just look at the bank in isolation . And also , if we look at the information in your package today , it looks like a loan to   deposit ratio of 39% or so . If you could just confirm whether this is at least one way to look at your company and highlight where you want to go with say the loan to deposit ratio or the ROA of the bank . How much would Morgan Stanley benefit if interest rates increased by 100BPS , maybe just on the bank side or for the firm as a whole ? I donâ??t think you guys have articulated it in that way . Okay . Thanks . And then lastly from me just on the Prime business , you spoke about it a lot today , just curious what youâ??re hearing from your clients in terms of pricing trend just given the implications for supplementary leverage ratio across the industry ? Great . If I can just transition quickly , on page seven of the supplement in the other funded loans category , which I recognize is small relative to the balance sheet , but up very significantly . I think the footnote suggests that much of this could be purchased loans . And Iâ??m just wondering what would be the strategy behind growing a purchased loan portfolio ? Ruth , you mentioned the lower funding costs earlier and itâ??s clear that theyâ??ve gone down a lot . How should we think about how long it takes to work its way through ? Is it really just the inverse of maybe the average maturity ? So in other words , you get a 15% to 20% of that benefit each year as your debt rolls ? Okay . Thatâ??s fair enough . I donâ??t know if youâ??ve already addressed it in pieces across the other questions , but you mentioned pieces of re-pricing or attempts to re-price in prime brokerage , maybe a broader question of how you think the SLR is mostly impacting the big banks and brokers or impacting the markets and how it impacts how you do your balance sheet planning ? Thank you for all that . I just want to know are those commitments , is that securities-based lending ? Because my gut is a tough environment , while refi is dropping by 50% in the quarter , is that securities-based lending ? What am I looking at to see that kind of growth in commitments ? Because something good is happening . Okay . Thanks , Ruth . And switching over to the supplemental leverage ratio , can you discuss what the change in centralized clearing assumptions did to the model ? And is it simply earnings generation during the quarter that made up for that delta for that model change in the deposit inflows you mentioned ? Or is there something else thatâ??s going on ? I just wanted to clarify a little bit , the comment that Ruth made about the receipt , but not really deployment of the deposits . I mean , there must have been some impact on net interest income for GWM and maybe more broadly for the corporation from the receipt of those deposits , or is that not fair ? I just wanted to follow up on your comment , James , that youâ??re just beginning to see the benefits from acquisition of the 100% of the joint venture . I mean , your branches are already down , your profit marginâ??s up some , you have the deposits . Aside from additional loan penetration to your customers , what other benefits are there still to be achieved ?   Then last follow-up , what specific loan products by category would it be , a lot of mortgages ? Or what else in addition to that ? Okay . And then just separately , as we think about the remaining $35B or so deposits coming in and some of the benefit that you still get from what just came on , how should we think about the blended yield you deploy that into ? Obviously , itâ??s going to be a mix of retail loans , corporate loans and some securities , but whatâ??s maybe a good blended yield to think about ? Like for example , maybe changing the way you look at repo or anything like that . Okay , alright then â?? Iâ??m sorry , go ahead . Just a follow-up on an earlier question on the 100% growth you expect in lending . Just be helpful to get some color on where youâ??re seeing such robust loan demand . Is it completely new loan demand from your clients ? Or is it your clients switching from existing lending providers to you ? And what is it about your lending program that is driving such outsized growth relative to the industry ? Thanks very much . Ruth , just to go back to slide 14 for a moment . Obviously , the simple math is that looking at the potential numerator benefits gets you to 6% to 6.3%. But Iâ??m just curious about the box that you have in terms of potential offsets , which first cites the balance sheet growth . Iâ??m just trying to reconcile that with what James indicated the targets are on page 11. So does this outlook on 14 embed this asset growth , and driven by the deposit growth over the next two years ? Hi . Good morning . Thanks for the call and thanks for all of the information , very comprehensive .Okay . So and how does that fit in with the liquidity slide on 26? Okay . So that\\'s kind of in front of the liquidity pool then ? The other question was really kind of the interaction between the SLR plus minimum debt requirements by the FDIC and your excess liquidity pile of $181 billion . Press reports have said that banks may increase the return within their excess liquidity portfolio by taking on kind of more risky positions . How do you look towards your excess liquidity portfolio going forward and to kind of increase the returns overall in that area ? Hi . On slide 26, the liquidity slide . You gave some guidance that the non-bank liquidity portion should be modestly lower . What about the bank liquidity part of the ...? A quickie on loan â?? loan commitments have been coming down . Theyâ??re actually down like in half . Is that a function of the environment , or a little more a function of the Basel III , Dodd-Frank world that weâ??re going to live in ?  Thanks , Ruth . And , then just finally for me , can you discuss your wholesale funding plans over the next two years ? I think you have maybe $45 billion-ish maturing through 2014. How much would you let roll off ? And , how do you think that funding schedule potentially changes if you buy in the rest of the JV this year ? Thanks .  No , but â?? itâ??s clear , thank you . That helps a lot . And , then finally just â?? not to harp on this margin target on GWM , but it almost sounds like you want to raise the target there except that you donâ??t want to do that in the face of some seasonality in Q1 on the expense base and I understand that . But , should we be thinking that it goes up â?? that the target goes up beyond Q1?  Okay . Last quickie is just you guys , your growth has been great , as you noted , in both the PLAs and the residential real estate loans . Are the FAAs being especially incented to drive that ? I know it comes at a higher profitability for the firm , does the low â?? is the offset of rates not going up for you guys , low rates actually help drive the growth in those lending products ? All right , thatâ??s helpful . So if you think about the $180B , there is $25B thatâ??s sort of run-off beyond that , but you might be re-investing , depending on the environment . Is that the way to think about it ?   Okay . How much do interest rates help if they increase and how much do they hurt if they donâ??t increase ? I mean , some of the more traditional banking peers will actually quantify this for us and you havenâ??t done that . Can you just help size the benefit or the harm ? Just two quick follow-ups . The deposit data of 45% seems somewhat low compared to many traditional banks . Are you sure about that ? Itâ??s not a whole lot of sensitivity there . And then low rates , if it stays lower for longer , what impact does that have on your refinancing of your debt ? You issued a lot of debt when your credit spreads were blown out two years ago and now they have come in . Can you take advantage of that ? A quick one first , the $141mm gain that you laid out , was that only on that real estate sale or does it also include the gain on TransMontaigne ? Okay . So is it possible that the growth rate might have even been higher if we X out the physical business ? I had a question for you about debt repurchases that I think you did during the quarter , maybe you can give us a sense for amounts , timing , how you think about debt repurchase activity as part of your long term capital management plans ? And I have a couple follow ups . Thanks .   Is it ever possible to include in that debt repurchase significant amounts of the structured products that give rise to the DVA or have you thought about anything else you could try to do â?? to put on some hedges or something now to try to lock in some of these very significant gains ?  All of what you say on funding , risk exposures , liquidity , makes a lot of sense , but whether itâ??s a result of market rumors or not , I guess the reality of the situation is the CDS spreads widened during the quarter . So other than DVA and the opportunity to buy back debt , I mean , how exactly does that widening impact what all you have to do on a day to day basis and in the client-facing business ?  So youâ??ve spoken loud and clear on liquidity rising , PB actually not affected , the number of clients actually went up . Just curious finishing off that â?? on the hoopla in the quarter , were there many novations away in the quarter ? It sounds like you defended the fort great , just figured Iâ??d ask ?  On the liquidity front , and we have some upcoming debt maturities , but you obviously have lots of liquidity to handle that . Whatâ??s the right , how do you strike the balance ? Whatâ??s the right long term average maturity or duration of the debt outstanding ? Itâ??s come down over the last couple of years to about five years and I didnâ??t know how you strike that balance , maybe thatâ??s in response to the balance sheet coming down ?  So all things equal that should go away if the markets stay stable ?  Got it . Okay . The debt that you repurchased during the quarter , what was the â?? can you say what the gain was on that ?  Okay . And are you blocked out like with companies are with stock repurchases around earnings or anything , can you buy debt any time ?  All right . Your long-term debt has continued to decline . So when you look out over maybe a next couple of years , where should â?? where\\'s the right level for â?? I think it\\'s around 100?  Okay . Okay . And on that â?? the latter business spend , the Wealth Management business , we have seen kind of a move here in the two- and three-year treasury . Is there any benefit that we can expect down the line for you guys from that move ? Or is the deposit investment far shorter and only really like the 6-month LIBOR would have an impact ? Okay . And just a follow-up on the spread question on the deposits . As you pull in $55B over the next 24 months , how do we think about â?? you talked about your leverage is more on the short end . But in the short â?? in the near-term , I assume youâ??re putting it mostly in AFS portfolio . And with the backup in yields in the intermediate bond area , wouldnâ??t you get some benefit ? I know your target was 1% spread before the rate spike . Should that â?? should we be assuming a little bit better than that ? Thanks for that . And the bank deposit build on the retail side is directly related to the percentage ownership of the joint venture , isnâ??t that right ?  Okay .  Question , Ruth , I heard all your comments regarding funding cost and debt issuance or debt decreasing in the quarter .  Actually I have the opposite question on debt issuance , plans going forward , and I think your average maturities in that five-year range has come down over time where my intuition would tell me that youâ??d want to be extending duration especially â?? some of the things that Moodyâ??s points out on the business needing to stand on its own two feet .  Can we â??  can you help us think through what your debt issuance plans are and how you think about todayâ??s funding costs , where they should be over time ?  I havenâ??t figured that out either .  So just , and it reminds me of another point I wanted to ask on the balance sheet , so you said the average balance sheet , your inventory levels were down , can you characterize how the ending balance sheet may have looked vs . the average or vs . the end of Q4?  Can you put any dollar amounts ?  I mean is it flat , is it up , is it down just vs . last quarter ?  And then just last question on this topic , the collateral posting , so it looks like youâ??ve posted a little less than half of what youâ??re potentially obligated to . Is that just a function of the other half not having been called ?  Any chance to know what the net new assets were this quarter ?  The first question I have relates to the drop in corporate lending commitments . Iâ??m just curious if you can provide some color as to whatâ??s going on there . Does that imply a substantially lower risk appetite , or was there a specific transaction that got done , or could you provide some color around that ?  I just want to follow up on , youâ??re sitting on about 23% of your balance sheet in excess liquidity . Can you discuss where you are sitting in terms of the LCR ? Do you feel like youâ??re pretty comfortable with that or do you need to build more ?  Okay . Maybe just a follow-up , as you buy in the rest , should we â??   what is the timing around the deposits ? And how quickly do think you can reinvest them ? And then I guess longer-term , do you think that can help you bring down the excess liquidity and , obviously , help improve profitability ?  So we should see that excess liquidity start to come down as those deposits come in ?  Oh , sure . Right . In the short term it could go up , right .  Okay . And shifting over to Wealth Management , youâ??re redeploying the deposits . What are the yields and margin that youâ??re getting as you deploy those deposits ?  Good morning , everyone . Thanks for the call . David , this is probably for you , or actually maybe Ruth . You talked about LCR compliance at the hold-co but what about at the bank ? What are the large universal banks this quarter talked about potentially doing some bank level of debt issuance in support of becoming LCR compliant there and just your thought there . I know you\\'re dealing with a ton of excess liquidity already with the Citi deposits , but are you comfortable at the bank as well ?  Morning . Thank you again for hosting this call . Just a question on slide 27, the detailed breakdown of the liquidity reserve . The composition has changed since the last call . You have some obvious deposit growth there . But maybe , could you provide some more detail about how we should think about using repos and also securities available for sale here ?  Okay . And just to follow up on the AFS portfolio within slide 32. I had a question on the FFELP student loan assets and just how do you think about that going forward and the size of this particular asset . I mean , is it going to be relatively consistent or potentially declining over time ?  Okay . And then just quickly , obviously , you guys have talked about the deposit deployment and being able to move some of the institutional business into the bank , replacing some of the unsecured funding . Is there anything you can call or you can give us on how much might be left that can be moved into the bank or is expected to ? And also just kind of where you guys are as far as the movement of derivatives and what else might be left there as well ?  Okay , got it . And just as my follow-up question , Rob , given your comments on the LCR , it sounds like most of the LCR-driven liquidity action should be fully in the run rate at this point . So there shouldnâ??t be further incremental hits from LCR-related balance sheet optimization at this point . Great . It was better because more operational deposits than what you could have potentially had ? Got it ., okay . And then two questions one on Fed policy , letâ??s take the other side of the question that Erika had , letâ??s say , the global growth is not as bad as people think and rates start to go back up . The Fed put out this comment back in September saying that the RRP would be capped at $300B . So do you end up raising rates through increasing IOER ? Does your interest rate sensitivity stay the same , because the question is does IOER going up impact your asset yields since most of that is based off of Fed funds at the front of the curve ? Okay . The technical part of the question I was asking was that if youâ??re not able to lift LIBOR or prime , because Fed fund isnâ??t moving , thenâ?¦ I mean I get the point that you totally got a better â?? youâ??re asset-sensitive with excess reserves and so your earnings go up . But if your loan balances are not able to react as Fed fund stays where it is , then do you pass anything on to depositors or does it make you less asset-sensitive than you usually have ? Okay . And then just on loan growth , because I know it was a little bit lighter Q-on-Q , but second quarter was very strong . Just want to understand what youâ??re thinking will be driving that C&I over the next couple of quarters ? Right and driven by more plant and equipment investing ? Okay , and then actually just lastly , if I could sneak in on the interest rates here . I think you and some other banks talked about not reinvesting some of the proceeds as much in Q3. And I think thatâ??s one of the reasons why rates are coming down so much; that a lot of folks were trying to stay shorter on their duration and now youâ??re having to squeeze . I guess itâ??s just like what do you do now ? Do you wait it out ? Do you let the securities book shrink a little bit more , or do you hedge it ? My question goes back to â?? and I think you made a comment , and Iâ??m not sure if I heard it correctly , it goes back to the core NII and the total NII . You talked about higher liquidity position is driving that lower and lower asset yields . But did you mention something about reinvestment opportunities ? In other words , are you making a decision to pull back a little bit until you get â?? so you can redeploy with better yields maybe down the road since you do think the Fed at some point is going to raise rates ?   William S . Demchak President , Chief Executive Officer & DirectorAnd on the same token with growing your loan book , I know a lot of people are saying thereâ??s still a lot of price competition . Is that the same thing , keeping your powder dry for an opportunity to when commercial yields do go up , you can take advantage of it ? Bill , youâ??ve talked about deposit betas likely being higher in the next rate cycle , but given uncertainty around the timing of when those rate hikes will come . I was hoping you could separate any Fed rate moves from the impact of QE coming to an end . So ex any Fed rate moves , do you think the end of QE will translate into a slowdown in overall industry deposit growth , not necessarily that deposits growth will turn negative , but just a slowing of the growth in kind of a post-QE environment . And as a follow-up to that , overall industry growth has been pretty decent , particularly on the commercial side . Can you talk about how you guys are positioned for an environment where that deposit growth does slow and maybe the industry , as a whole , kind of the implications for that slowing of deposit growth , but the continuation of the loan growth that weâ??re seeing ? Right . Thatâ??s very helpful . Thank you . If I can squeeze just one last one in . Can you update us on what youâ??re seeing in terms of any pockets within the commercial lending space where you find yourself just walking away because of the unattractive economics ? And then maybe the same question to the extent that anything stands out on the consumer side . Okay . And just to be clear , are you saying youâ??ll definitely use the whole thing for this year or is it kind of market and price dependent and other factors as well ? And then , just as a follow-up , if I look at your commercial portfolio , loans to manufacturing borrowers , theyâ??re up the strongest y-over-y , but flat q-over-q . Was that just some quarter-end volatility or was there a noticeable change that happened last year ? Two questions . First of all , on loan growth , weâ??ve had a lot of questions on commercial loan growth . I guess Iâ??m curious given some of the regulatory data thatâ??s come out over the quarter that seemed to show a broadening of loan growth across consumer , as well as more and more banks becoming a bit more willing to lend to the consumer , that for your loan balances , it looked like it was a similar story this quarter vs . the prior quarters of automobile continuing to grow , but not much growth , in fact negative trends in most of the other consumer lines . Can you give us a sense as to where youâ??re seeing demand or in fact , if PNC doesnâ??t really tie into most of the industry data in terms of consumer lending ? And the degree of roll-off quarter-by-quarter is consistent with what you had pre the sale of these assets ?  Okay . And then , as we think about the core net interest income in the back half of the year , you mentioned that you have some of the higher-cost CDs rolling off . Thatâ??s obviously helping . As we think about a little bit longer term beyond this year , youâ??ve got the roll-off of the non-investment grade securities . How do you think about the puts and takes there in terms of you might not have as much liability flexibility beyond this year and then you still have some of the drag on the non-investment grade ? Do you think you can -  Richard J . Johnson Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President , PNC Financial Services Group , Inc .Good morning . Paul wanted to follow-up on the C&I loans . Maybe you can give more color around what regions youâ??re seeing and specifically what pockets , a little more color around the C&I loan growth ?  Morning . Thanks . Hey , good morning . Just got two questions . The first is just going back to the net interest income guidance . It looks like last year , the core net interest income was around $7.6B , if you back out the purchase accounting adjustments . So , I guess the question that I have is that your guidance for 2011 is something kind of stable with that , plus the benefits of the deposits that youâ??ve got re-pricing or is that included in that ?  Good morning . I guess on the accreteable yield , if the run rateâ??s going to step down but the total stock of accreteable yield seems to be staying at $2.9B every quarter , does that imply weâ??re going to have a fairly kind of consistent , if lower , run rate straight through 2013 or I guess how long should we think about that accreteable yield sticking around , even if weâ??re not really considering it core ?  Two quick questions . Some of them have been answered . In terms of you talked about the $11B CDs re-pricing this year , $11B next year , you gave us the rates that theyâ??re currently -- the cost of those CDs currently . Could you give us some thoughts on where you would expect them to re-price to , how much you would expect to run off ? I mean , where do you expect that sort of $11B to go in terms of staying on or leaving the balance sheet and at about what cost ?  Okay . So , that second piece you would say a low percentage of those are likely to stick around ?  Two questions , first on loans . So , you talked about the strong C&I and loans actually did grow this quarter . Just wondering , can you tell us a little bit more about where youâ??re expecting loan growth to come from in the future and connected to that how , if at all , is the pace of run-offs changing in the non-core book ?  Just two questions . One , on the â?? you mentioned that line utilization rates were up this quarter . Could you give us some color around what the numbers were ?  Yeah . Can you give us some color ? Are your customers just that much stronger or is it the economy , a combination of both ? Do you expect that trend to continue , meaning lower inflows as we get into H2?  I was wondering , Rob , in terms of the loan growth , are you seeing any change in customer mindset on loan demand or is the growth you are seeing still kind of market share gains ? Okay . And the core NII did well this quarter . What is your outlook for the core NII assuming the kind of current rate environment ? What are some of the puts and takes on growing core NII ? Got it . I was thinking broader for the year ex-purchase accounting . It\\'s really loan growth vs . still low rates ? Okay . And obviously , you showed very strong commercial growth , loan growth this quarter . Is there any uptick on the consumer demand yet ? I know there was a small uptick in loans through this quarter , but are you seeing any change in mindset there ? My first question is just on the size of the balance sheet going forward . So loans , securities and cash were all up on a q-over-q basis and we get the loan guidance for modest growth in Q1, but how would you expect the securities balances and liquidity to trend going forward ? Okay . And then a final one on loan yields . So we saw them start to flatten out this quarter and just wondering if you think we should start to kind of see loan yields bottom here when we move through 2014? Got it . And my follow-up question is â?? thank you for the color that you gave in terms of further potentially building your liquidity position , but once that\\'s behind us , if we just think about the core margin for this year , excluding purchase accounting and think about where the forward curve is indicating , is it too optimistic to think that the core margin ex-purchase accounting , will bottom in 2014? I\\'m representing myself too . Just given that answer , I guess , I\\'m intrigued about your guidance in the discussion for net interest income because since you do have growth in loans and presumably earning assets , maybe could   you just flesh out your expectations for full-year net interest income ? We know you\\'ve got kind of $300mm of purchase accounting reductions that you\\'ve got to face , but --. Right . But I guess I was referring to the comment about the stabilization of the core margin during the year that would sort of lend credence to that ... Right , right . Okay , I was just thinking you might be able to do more in non-footprint locations than you have been doing , but I guess your answer is no . But you won\\'t provide what that was this quarter ? Right . Got it . And in terms of spread revenue , understood that kind of core NIM is still grinding lower , but then I thought I heard maybe a comment that we should think about spread revenue for this year being similar to last year . And on a core basis that was down 2%, 2.5%. Is that how we should be thinking about it ex-PCI or did I not understand that correctly ? Okay . But maybe loan growth could be better with maybe less margin pressure , but still there on a core basis so that loan growth theoretically could offset the ongoing pressure . Is that how we should think about it conceptually ? Okay . And that combines both the scheduled accretion and your outlook for cash recovery ? And whatâ??s your outlook for the kind of â?? the core NII ? In a flat rate environment , what would you expect from core NII ? And what are the puts and takes there on your outlook for core ? Going back a little bit on the net interest margin . How much of that decline was driven by your cash balances ? I notice some of your cash balance has really increased over the quarter . [ph] Story (29:20). And I guess back up real quick , a last question . You said youâ??re getting good penetration to C&I . I mean is it â?? how much of this is in the overall book ? Like , in other words , how much of that stuffâ??s coming in relative or on a percentage basis of your growth in loans on the overall ? ISI now , but thanks . Just wanted to touch on loan growth . It came in , I think , better than expectations this quarter . I know on the last quarterly call , you were talking about walking away from some deals where you didnâ??t like the terms and the structures . Have you seen any improvement there , or has it stabilized , at least ? And where are you guys taking some market share ? Okay . All right . Secondly , just with regards to asset yields and the core NIM , was down again a decent amount . And Iâ??ve heard some of your â?? heard your prior comments about not necessarily taking on more interest rate risk . But ex purchase accounting accretion , what are you seeing in terms of new loan yields relative to whatâ??s on the books ? And can you give us a little bit of color or just like whatâ??s rotating through the securities portfolio . Could you help us understand the increase in the installment home equity loans ? Youâ??ve had eight straight quarters of home equity installment loan growth . Could you just walk through some of the main drivers of whatâ??s occurring right now ? And are you â?? what the new yields youâ??re seeing , given the move in the long end of the yield curve ? Yeah . HARP vs . refi and how thatâ??s come through for your mortgage originations . Got it . Okay . Okay , thatâ??s helpful . And then on loan growth , Bill , anymore color on the degree of follow through on kind of the green shoots of better line utilization that you started to see at the end of last quarter , did that follow through to the same extent you had hoped it would or can you just give some color on that ? My first question sort of has to do with where you are on the LCR with regards to the current proposals . Could you give us an update on where you are and sort of how youâ??re thinking about future investments in terms of your excess deposits in your bond portfolio ? I did notice that your cash is up and your securities balances are down on an average basis . I just wanted to circle back to the NII dollars for a moment . Rob , so it seemed that all of the balance sheet dynamics ultimately pointed to what was essentially a down $4mm NII figure when you adjust for the security impact . But I guess the question that that raises is to the extent that youâ??re putting up very strong loan growth but getting price compression and at the same time funding that increasingly in a wholesale format and therefore   despite the balance sheet expansion not actually generating incremental dollars of revenue , how do we think about that dynamic ? Okay . Maybe perhaps Iâ??ll circle back with you because I may have misunderstood but it seemed that the NII dollars were effectively flat once you made all the adjustments . Right , right . And as your loan to deposit ratio is creeping up a bit here into the low 90%s , how are you thinking about that in a â?? particularly as you contemplate higher rates and is there some concern about what may happen with deposits under those circumstances ? Got it . So it sounds like your bias would be low end or possibly below low end of the current guidance ? Okay , great . And then second question just to drill down a little bit more into loan yields and understanding the shift of the move to fees from NII this quarter . Can you catalog for us explicitly where competition is pressuring loan yields the most vs . the amount of lingering , just negative rollovers youâ??re having from maturing loans . And so is it just that competition still really punching down or ? Can you talk a little bit about â?? I had been jumping all around , I donâ??t know exactly everything you said . But on your re-performing loan sales , I know thereâ??s a lot of people feel that thereâ??s a great opportunity be selling re-performing loans into the market . Do you foresee selling more loans going forward ? And then on â?? you might have talked about this already , but utilization rates , weâ??ve heard from a couple of institutions that they are up . I donâ??t think you really disclosed it in your documents . Can you talk a little bit about â?? are you seeing increase in utilization rates ? Okay . Coming back to Rob , you mentioned the gain on sale margin was obviously over 5% this quarter , which was helped by some of the fair value marks and on the fair value marks , I think Bill you said it was because of the scratch and dent loans in that , is that what helped you guys on the fair value marks on the mortgage side ? But just kind of a follow-up on the net interest income . As I look back to what you said three months ago , you talked about the purchase accounting accretion that really didnâ??t change and you talked about some of the other things . Iâ??m not sure that you talked so much about the general kind of spread compression . I mean , did your kind of view on that kind of soften during this quarter or is that a change or is that not ? Am I just reading too much into ? And as a follow-up to that , without using the word convexity , can you explain again why it makes sense for PNC to be an anomaly when it comes to shrinking the securities book ? And I do remember you were in a call before the financial crisis and you highlighted that correctly . So maybe if youâ??re an anomaly , more people should pay attention . Iâ??m just curious . So thatâ??s in a way an insurance policy against a negative impact from higher interest rates when they occur . And you said , another $225mm next year . So next year is that when conceptually the reported net interest margin this quarter of 3.12% intersects with the core net interest margin 2.92% or is there more in 2016? Just one additional question on margin compressions , for Rob , I guess . Rob , if you characterize your positioning relative to LCR and I realize the rules are not final . If you had 3BPS of compression this quarter from LCR , at what point do you think that might go down to no effect on margin q-over-q from your activity to prepare for LCR ? Okay . And then , I guess a bigger picture question . I mean , if you look at your average consumer loan balances , theyâ??ve been pretty flattish y-over-y , not growing as much as the commercial side of things , and I suspect some of thatâ??s demand rather than your underwriting , but if the employment situation continues to improve , household net worth has improved fairly materially over the last couple of years . How are you thinking about potentially tweaking your lending standards on the consumer side to potentially grow that book at yields that are presumably a bit better than youâ??re getting on the consumer side â?? sorry , on the commercial side ? And I did want to ask a follow-up question on the CD re-pricing that you mentioned that will occur in H1. The 2.5% rate that you gave us , is that the effective rate of taking into account any purchase accounting discount ? So if weâ??re doing the math , is it 2.5% to 33BPS on the $750B that you wish to retain or is the effective rate already lower than 2.5%?  Got it . And my last question is just a follow-up to Johnâ??s question . The net interest income guidance of mid to high single-digits , it includes that runoff in Nat City purchase accounting benefit and includes some estimate of purchase accounting from RBC ?  Thereâ??s been a lot of talk about banks purchasing some loans from , in part foreign banks looking to deleverage and Iâ??m just wondering what your appetite is in that area and what specific areas you might target ?  A question for you Rick , I think you gave the cost of funds in Q4 is 42BPS , is that correct ?  Wells Fargo gave their cost of funds , I think yesterday , at about 22BPS and Iâ??m assuming that thatâ??s probably the lower end of your peer group . Could you tell me where the 42BPS sort of lies within the peer group and how much lower you guys can or want to go ?  Do you guys have â?? I mean do you want to stay sort of in the middle of the pack in terms of deposit pricing or sort of what is the philosophy of deposit pricing right now ?  And secondly , I believe you mentioned that there might be further TRUP redemptions this year . Can you just remind us where you stand in TRUPs still on the balance sheet at this point and what the triggering event or what the thought process about future redemptions might be ?  Commercial loan growth , what was the change in loan utilization ? And is the loan growth coming from increased borrower demand or from market share ?  And so youâ??re bullish on PNCâ??s loan growth , not necessarily the industryâ??s loan growth because why â?? and how are you getting this loan growth if demandâ??s not picking up ?  Just had a couple questions on the margin . You gave some pretty good color on Q4 expectations . Wonder if you can just speak at a top level about some of the puts and takes from a core basis . I noticed the yields on most of the categories of the loan portfolio were down , in some cases kind of substantially . I imagine thatâ??s mostly the purchase accounting adjustments , but just am curious to what kind of pricing pressures youâ??re seeing out there on the asset side .  And then on the funding side , you alluded to potentially some additional TruPS redemption , so any comments you can make about further lowering your overall funding costs . And I guess along those lines , I noticed the cost of your retail CDs kind of jumped up in Q3. Just curious what was going on there and then if you can speak to overall deposit cost expectations as well .  Okay . And then the put back was $37mm but you guys have been talking the â?? $5mm to $10mm kind of go forward . Is this a true up or is this a change relative to that prior outlook ?  Okay , and a follow-up on Scottâ??s question with regard to the movement in core vs . purchase accounting accretion , of the 45BPS decline in C&I yields and the 52BPS decline in CRE yields , could you give us a sense of what percentage was attributed to lower purchase accounting accretion ?  Can you go back a little bit to the mortgage-backed securities â?? your securities portfolio ? And you mentioned that youâ??re replacing 3.3% with â?? 3.3% yielding assets with 2.3% yielding assets . What type of mix shift is that , because I think most people are looking at that low end being at 1.6%, 1.7%. Are you â?? can you just explain that a little bit ?  And then on loan demand , I know a lot of people asking about loan demand . Is there different geographic experiences ? Like , I know you guys are down in South â?? or youâ??re just getting there , and everybodyâ??s all hyped up about the Southeast and the housing recovery down there . Are you seeing more demand down there , or are you just not really established yet down there ?  Just really kind of follow-up to the earlier questions , more on new loan yields . I know C&I has been where most of the growth has come from . If I back out your accretion income , itâ??s kind of rough , but I get a core loan yield of maybe 430-ish basis points . Where would you say loans â?? replacement yields are on average ? I know there is  multiple products going in there , but where would you say that replacement yields are coming on new originations ?  Okay . And not â?? I mean it sounds like a little bit more competition from prior quarter but not a â?? I mean how would you characterize the change from last quarter on those origination yields ?  Depending on the timing of the trust preferred redemption â?? I donâ??t know what the timing is in fourth quarter , what is that going to save you in terms of interest expense for fourth quarter ?  Okay . And how much would that benefit be , specifically ?  '"
